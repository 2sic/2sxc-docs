# Formulas (Logic) in the Edit Form

[!include[](~/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>
  .context-box-summary .browser-edit-ui { visibility: visible; }
</style>

2sxc 12 introduces _Formulas_ which let you dynamically change all kind of things in the edit UI. With it you can dynamically change 

1. the **value** of the field
1. General field settigns like
    1. `Visibility` to show/hide a field
    1. `Disabled` to enable/disable a field
    1. `Name` to change the label
1. Field-specific settings like
  1. `Collapsed` on a field-group to change if it's open/closed
