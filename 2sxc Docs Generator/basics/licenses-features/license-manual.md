# Manually Add a License

[!include[](~/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .data-configuration { visibility: visible; }</style>

2sxc 13 has a new licensing system, and at the moment there is no UI to add a license. 

Until this is provided, here's how you add a license manually:

1. Get the license file from 2sxc - usually because you are a beta-tester or because you purchased it. The file will always have a name like `[something].license.json`
1. Put it into your `.data-custom\configurations` folder in 2sxc. Usually something like this:  
   `[some-root]\DesktopModules\ToSIC_SexyContent\.data-custom\configurations`
1. Restart your Dnn
1. Got to the System-Management (Apps-Management) and verify your license is active
