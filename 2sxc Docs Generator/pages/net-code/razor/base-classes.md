# `@inherits` Base Classes

Every Razor template inherits from a base class - and depending on that the features in the template will change.

## Recommendation for v17+

These are the base classes you can inherit from as of v14 (we'll explain each in more detail below)

1. `Custom.Hybrid.RazorTyped` - new in v16
1. `Custom.Hybrid.RazorTyped<TModel>` - new in v17.03
1. `AppCode.Razor.AppRazor` - new in v17.03 - requires that you have this class in your AppCode folder
1. `AppCode.Razor.AppRazor<TModel>` - new in v17.03 - requires that you have this class in your AppCode folder
1. `AppCode.Razor.Anything` - new in v17.03 - requires that you have this class in your AppCode folder

> [!TIP]
> Using these base classes ensures that you have the latest, typed APIs.

For older base classes and the differences, see [Compare Razor @inherits](xref:NetCode.TypedCode.CompareApis.RazorBase)










These are the base classes you can inherit from as of v14 (we'll explain each in more detail below)

1. `Custom.Hybrid.RazorTyped` - new in v16
1. `Custom.Hybrid.RazorTyped<TModel>` - new in v17.03
1. `Custom.Hybrid.Razor14` - new in v14
1. `Custom.Hybrid.Razor12` - new in v12
1. `Custom.Dnn.Razor12` - v12; same as Hybrid, but with `Dnn` property
1. `ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent` - v10
1. `ToSic.SexyContent.Razor.SexyContentWebPage` - very old since v2 - deprecated, but the default if nothing is set.
1. Default in Oqtane


Important: If you don't specify an `@inherits` in your code, the system will automatically apply a default base class to your code. This is different in Dnn and Oqtane:

1. In Dnn the default base class is `ToSic.SexyContent.Razor.SexyContentWebPage` as it's specified in a `web.config` in the 2sxc folder of each site.  
  This is the oldest base class and should not be used any more.
1. In Oqtane the default base is `#todoc` which is the default for .net 5

## Custom.Hybrid.Razor14

This is the newest base class and recommended to use.
It's almost identical with Razor12 with these differences:

1. the `Kit` property is new, providing access to the ServiceKit called ServiceKit14
1. the `Convert` property is removed, as it caused confusion with `System.Convert`

Note that the hybrid base classes don't have a `Dnn` property as they are hybrid and work on Oqtane and Dnn.

If you think you need the Dnn property, best first check if the [CmsContext](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Context) can't be used instead.

Otherwise inherit from `Custom.Dnn.Razor12` and just get the Services you need with GetService.

## Custom.Hybrid.Razor12

This is the newest base class and was introduced in 2sxc 12. It contains the features which will work cross-platform on both Dnn and Oqtane. You should use this base class to create solutions / Apps which work on Dnn and Oqtane.

### Limitations of Custom.Hybrid.Razor12

Since this base class is meant to work on both Dnn and Oqtane, it only supports features which both of these platforms support.

1. The property `Dnn` doesn't exist on this base class, as it would lead to code which can't run cross-platform
1. As of now the properties / methods `CustomizeData(...)`, `CustomizeSearch(...)` and `Purpose` do not work, because Oqtane doesn't have a search indexer. We plan on introducing something like this once Oqtane provides search, but as of now it's not yet clear how this would work.
1. The code-behing `Code` object doesn't work, as we probably cannot implement this in .net 5
1. The `CreateInstance(...)` works only on C# files `.cs` but not with CSHTML files `.cshtml` as this probably won't work in .net 5
1. Koi works differently than before. Previously you just used a global object `Connect.Koi.Koi` to use Koi, but because .net 5 should really use dependency injection, you should now get Koi using `GetService<Connect.Koi.ICss>()`. The old mechanism will still work in Dnn but would not work in Oqtane.

#### Platform Differences

Internally `Custom.Hybrid.Razor12` is built on the Razor base classes of the .net frameworks, so in Dnn it builds on `#todoc` while in Oqtane it builds on `#todoc`. Because of this, certain features will work in Dnn which don't work in Oqtane and vice versa.

* If you only want to create Oqtane stuff only, you can just go ahead and use all the new features of the Razor in .net 5
* If you plan on creating real hybrid stuff, you will have to do some testing to ensure you didn't use features that don't exist on the other side
* If you need to code something which is different in each platform, use the `#if` [preprocessor statements](xref:NetCode.Razor.Hybrid.Index)

Some core feature differences

| Feature | Dnn | Oqtane | Comments
| --- | :-: | :-: | ---
| `@inherits` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `@helper` | ✅ | ⛔ | Doesn't exist in .net 5
| `@model` | ⛔ | ✅ | Doesn't exist in old .net and can't be combined with `@inherits`

### Internal Docs: Dnn API Controller Inheritance

Basis for everything:

1. `System.Web.WebPages.WebPageBase`
    1. 🥷🏽 `ToSic.Sxc.Web.RazorComponentBase`
        _internal base for all Razor Pages in DNN_  
        🔹 adds dynamic code context, `Html` helper, etc.  
        🔹 adds simple `Log` object  
        🔹 Adds logging to insights  
        🔹 Base class for everything

Based on that these public base classes were made:

1. ⭐💀 `ToSic.SexyContent.Razor.SexyContentWebPage` _public, very old/deprecated_  
    _oldest base class, should not be used any more_  
    🔹 TODO: MUST CHECK IF THIS IS STILL THE DEFAULT in web.config  
    🔹 had some exotic propecties such as `List` which contained Content/Presentation pairs  
    1. 🥷🏽 `ToSic.SexyContent.Razor.SexyContentWebPage<T>` _internal, only for technical reasons_
1. ⭐💀 `ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent` _public, old/deprecated_  
    _was the replacement for the previous, without the exotic `List`_
    🔹 Had old APIs such as `CustomizeData` and `CustomizeCode` which isn't needed any more  
    1. ⭐💀 `ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponentCode` _public, old/deprecated_  
      _used for deprecated feature: code-behind_
1. ⭐💀 `Custom.Hybrid.Razor12` _public, recommended to move to 14_  
    _works fine, but is missing some newer features_
    🔹 Removed `CustomizeData` and `CustomizeCode`  
    🔹 Had a public object `Convert` which interfered with the `System.Convert`
1. 🥷🏽 `Custom.Hybrid.Advanced.Razor14<TModel, TServiceKit>` _internal_  
    🔹 adds the `Kit` property with all kinds of ready-to-use Services  
    🔹 also removes the `.Convert` object, which is now on Kit.Convert
    1. ⭐🌟 `Custom.Hybrid.Razor14` _public, **recommended**_

## History

* 2sxc 10.20 - changed to `Purpose` from `InstancePurpose` - old code still works
