# Documentation Tags

If you find such tags in a documentation, this means that whatever you are reading is marked because it's not done, needs more documentation or whatever (or that we forgot to remove the marker).

## wip
This tag means Work-In-Progress.

## todoc
This means that the feature exists, but needs documentation - you could help contribute :). 

## todo
This means that something should be done some time.
