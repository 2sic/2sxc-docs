Didn't have time to document this yet, sorry. If you need to know, best check the git-history.




## Version 10

### Version 10.01 - 10.09 LTS
* Develop and fine-tuning of the new Edit-UI based on Angular 8

### Version 10.20-00 to 10.20-05

* Enhanced ListCache so it will prevent parallel buildup - important for long-loading DataSources like SharePoint DataSources
* Updating to RazorBlade 3.1 which doesn't need extension methods

### Version 10.20-06

* Created `AsDynamic(string)`
* Created `AsDynamic(DataSource)` to enable `AsDynamic(Data)` instead of `AsDynamic(Data["Default"])`

### Version 10.21

* New `AsList()` for better code
* New `AsDynamic(string)` to work with json
* `/dist/` is now cleaned up on every update, to better distribute changing JS file structures

### Version 10.22

* Query Params added for Visual Query
* Created QueryRun DataSource
* Insights now includes the code file and line numbers
* Insights now also measures time needed to execute some code
* Various performance enhancements
* Improved SoC for AppsCache and AppRoot DataSource

### Version 10.23

* Lots of logging enhancements

### Version 10.24 LTS

* New stable LTS
* Improved/fixed QueryRun DataSource
* Improved Insights
* Enhancements to use 2sxc with Redis Cache
* WYSIWYG enhancements for better H1-Hx, P and Blockquote
* Performance enhancements
* Intenal refactoring for APIs
* Introduced an internal Compatibility-Level to disable very old features when using new RazorComponents

### Version 10.25 LTS

* Changed how the $2sxc client JavaScripts are loaded for much better performance and better Google PageSpeed
* Enabled various features for the Content area which previously were hidden, like Resources and Settings
* Released brand new Content-Templates App with best-practices for 10.25
* Fixed bugs with Evoq Page Publishing

### Version 10.26

* TinyMCE Updated to 5.1
* Enhanced `CreateInstance` API to also work when compiling Razor files from a WebApi
* New DataSource `StreamPick`
* New automatic Param called `[Params:ShowDrafts]` to be used in VisualQuery - returns `True` or `False`
* New tokens `[App:AppId]` and `[App:ZoneId]` to use in VisualQuery calles (dropdown from query)
* Changed List-Caching behaviour to create more reliable cache-keys for complex queries (previously it only went through `Default` streams to generate the cache-key)

### Version 10.27

#### Possibly breaking changes

1. Because the dynamic entity list now has a type which is dynamic, it cannot be cast to `List<dynamic>` any more. `IList<dynamic>` works, but in case you have any code casting it to `List<dynamic>` you'll need to change that to either `IList<dynamic>` or `IEnumerable<dynamic>`.

#### New Features / Major Improvements

*  Changed DynamicEntity so that accessing a property which contains many other entities it will return a `DynamicEntityWithList`. This allows Razor files to access the properties like `.EntityId` or `.FirstName` of the main entity in a sub-list easily without requiring `AsList(...)` [#1993](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1993)
* Updated Quick-Dialog to use Angular 9, Ivy and the latest Dnn-Sxc-Angular [#1992](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1992)
* New DataSource [](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.AttributeRename) [#2004](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/2004)
* Completely refactored internal list management API [#1995]((https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1995))
* Complete refactoring of the inpage code to make it typesafe (no more `any` types)
* Created brand-new, [simpler way to create custom Toolbars](xref:HowTo.Customize.Toolbars) and [specs](xref:Specs.Cms.Toolbars.Build)
* Introduces [JS/API 2sxc-Insights](xref:HowTo.Debug.Home) for debugging In-Page code

#### Enhancements

* Performance-Enhance App DataSource to delay building objects until needed [#1991](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1991)
* Performance-Enhance internal Token Lookup [#1998](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1998)
* Enhanced DNN Search Index logging [#1997](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1997)
* Corrected help-links on all data sources [#1994](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1994)

#### Bugfixes

* Cache-All-Streams only used the Default-Streams for Cache-Key identification [#1988](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1988)
* QueryRun DataSource doesn't show statitics on all streams [#1989](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1989)
* Modified date and Owner information were missing on json stored entities [#2005](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/2005) / [#2006](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/2006)
* Fixed bug in JS API for non-2sxc endpoint resolution [#2000](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/2000)
* Queries didn't resolve DNN tokens when accessed in the Search Index [#1999](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1999)



## Version 11

### Version 11.00

#### Breaking Changes

The following changes are all super-low-profile, but we want to document them just to be through:

1. `DataStream` and `IDataStream` loses a very old property called `.LightList` - we're pretty sure it's not in use anywhere, if you have it, just use `.List` instead. 


#### Enhancements

1. Brand new Admin UI based on Angular 9 and Ivy with new Code-Editor, new Visual Query and much more
1. Razor CodeBehind
1. Automatic Polymorphism
1. Updated Razor Blades to 3.02 with the new `Tags.SafeUrl(...)` command
1. Field: Boolean-Tristate which saves true/false/null
1. `App.Data.Create(...)` now returns entities it just created

### Version 11.01

#### Enhancements

1. In-Page Toolbar now recognises sub-item lists and provides sorting and editing buttons #2009
1. Item-lists now have a button to add existing items to them #1278
1. New system to create extensions in an app, in the system folder
1. Ability to create custom Input Fields just by placing them in the system folder #2070

#### Minor

1. Improve Equality Check for DynamicEntities and EntitiesInList #2075 
1. Data-table in admin UI now shows `Title` field no matter if there is another field which is the title #1639 
1. Button to flush app-cache in admin-ui #2073 
1. 2sxc Insights now available from the super-user toolbar #2069 
1. PT translations are added again #2064 
1. Loads of enhancements and minor issues in the UI

### Version 11.02

#### Enhancements

1. App-Extensions system in the folder `system`
1. Custom WebComponent based input fields #2082 
1. API to reconfigure the wysiwyg input control #2090
1. Show view use with links to pages and more #2077 
1. UI - fields can now be set to not-translate #2086 
1. UI - boolean can now show different labels based on the value it has #2085 

#### Minor

1. Add HR language pack for editor #2087 
1. show app-name in admin ui
1. show app-icon in apps-management #2078 


### Version 11.03 - todo

### Version 11.04 - todo

### Version 11.05

1. Old Edit UI be removed
1. Old Admin-UI be removed
1. APIs which only the old UIs used be removed
1. Old helper JS for AngularJS apps (located in `/js/angularjs`) will be removed from the distribution. 
They had not been updated for over 3 years and we believe they were not widely used. 
Anybody upgrading will still preserve the files that are there. 
If you really need them, download an old release of 2sxc and get them manually.
