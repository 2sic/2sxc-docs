# Field Input-Type **string-dropdown**

Use this field type for configuring simple dropdown UI elements, storing [string/text data](xref:Specs.Data.Values.String). It's an extension of the [string field type](xref:Specs.Data.Inputs.String).

## Features 

1. provide values to select
1. provide visible labels which are different from the stored value
2. optionally allow users to type in something different (2sxc 9.10)

## Special Behaviour

1. When the drop-down UI element finds data stored, which doesn't match any of the values it has available, it will leave that data intact unless the users selects something manually

## Configuring a String-Dropdown
This shows the configuration dialog:

## Using the Dropdown with the optional free-text-entry (2sxc 9.10)
This is what the UI looks like, if _Enable Free Text_ is enabled

If the user then clicks on the I-bar icon, the input will change to text so you could type something different - like a value which wasn't suggested, or a token.
