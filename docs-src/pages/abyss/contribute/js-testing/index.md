## Pre-Requisites

* all the pre-requisites for building 2sxc

## Background

On 2sxc and the EAV project we strive to have many unit tests, but as always it's hard to keep up.

One of the challenges is also that some of the tests were written when we were less experienced, so we would do it better today.
So if you do review some tests, note that they may not use the latest best practices.

## Desired Setup and Conventions

As of 2025-12 we want to use Vitest for all our unit tests.
