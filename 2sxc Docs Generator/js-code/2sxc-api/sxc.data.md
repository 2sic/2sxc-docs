# Data Services of the Sxc Controller (WIP #v13)

[!include[](~/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .interact-2sxc { visibility: visible; } </style>

A common need in JS is to read/write data from/to the backend. 

2sxc 12 / 13 introduce new JS APIs for this. 

* `data(...)` gets a data service to get one or many items of the same type, and also create/update data (this document)
* `query(...)` gets a query service to call server-side queries ðŸ‘‰ [docs](xref:JsCode.2sxcApi.Sxc.Query)

_Note: You can do all what these services do using [webApi.fetch(...)](xref:JsCode.2sxcApi.Sxc.WebApi.Fetch), but this is more convenient._

> [!TIP]
> You may sometimes find old code which does something like `data.on(...)` or `data.sourceUrl` - this is obsolete and will not work any more.

## Get a Data Service

1. Get the [sxc instance controller](xref:JsCode.2sxcApi.Sxc.Index) of the current module
1. Call `data(contentTypeName)` to get the service

Example:

```csharp
const modId = @CmsContext.Module.Id;
const sxc = $2sxc(modId);
const authorsSvc = sxc.data('Authors');
authorsSvc.getAll().then(authors => console.log(authors));
```

## Data Service Factory Parameters

The `data(...)` factory just has one parameter: the `contentTypeName`. 

The returned service will always perform actions for this content-type. 

## Data Service APIs

Data Services always return a [modern Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) containing data. 

A Data Service has the following commands:

* `getAll()` - no parameters, will return an array of all items of this content-type
* `getOne(id)` - `id` is an int - will return a single item of this content-type
* `create(objectWithValues)` - `objectWithValues` is a JS object with keys/values - will create the item and return it
* `create(objectWithValues, metadataFor)` - `metadataFor` creates an item as metadata for something TODO: DOCUMENT
* `update(id, objectWithValues)` - performs an update on the targeted item and returns the item. Note that objectWithValues can also just have a few properties, all others will be left as is.


## Create Metadata

When using `create(..., ...)` with two parameters you are creating metadata. The signature of the address-object is as follows:

```js
{
  TargetType: int; // one of known target types
  Number?: number; // Key if it's a number key
  String?: string; // Key if it's a string ey
  Guid?: string;   // Guid if it's a GUID key
}
```
