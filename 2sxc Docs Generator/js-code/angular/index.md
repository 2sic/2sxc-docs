# Using Angular in 2sxc / DNN

[!include[](../../basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .spa-all { visibility: visible; } </style>

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is an awesome JavaScript framework to build applications, especially SPA style applications. 

We've created a full solution for integrating Angular with DNN and 2sxc and it's documented here. 
The core parts are: 

1. Integrate Angular in DNN for [runtime](xref:JsCode.Angular.IntegrateAngularRuntime) or [development](xref:JsCode.Angular.IntegrateAngularDevelopment)
1. Integrate DNN into Angular
1. Integrate 2sxc and CMS features into Angular

## Get Started

1. Discover the [Template Angular App](xref:JsCode.Angular.TemplateApp) to first experiment with it
1. Then either just modify the Template App to make it into anything you want
1. Or create an own solution using the parts you like



Check out the [dnn-sxc-angular NPM package](xref:Npm.Dnn-Sxc-Angular)
