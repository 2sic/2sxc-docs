# How to Use a Dynamic Entity

Whenever you create a content-type - like _Person_ - and want to work with the data in your C# Razor templates, you'll be working with a _Dynamic Entity_. 

> [!TIP]
> Also read about [](xref:HowTo.DynamicCode.AsDynamic)

## Code example using a Dynamic Entity

We'll assume we have a _Content Type_ called *Book* with the following properties:
* Title (text, 1-line)
* Teaser (text, multi-line)
* Description (text, html)
* ReleaseDate (date)
* Author (entity - another content item)

Here's a code example in a C# Razor template:

```html
<!--
  The default variable for the current item is Content, 
  we'll just use another name for this sample
  note that .Title is automatically provided, 
  because the content-type has the property title. 
-->
<h1>@Content.Title</h1>
<div>@Content.Description</div>
<div>Author: @Content.Author[0].FullName</div>
```
So basically all properties of this book can be shown using `[Object].[PropertyName]` - for example `Content.ReleaseDate`.

## What Dynamic Entity really does - and how...

Technically the dynamic entity object is like a read-helper for the more complex [](xref:ToSic.Eav.Data.IEntity). So actually the _dynamic entity_ object will keep a reference to the underlying read-only `IEntity` item on a property `Entity`, and whenever your code accesses a property, the dynamic entity will query it from the underlying `Entity`.

The main things that the _dynamic entity_ does for you, are

1. Give you a nice, short syntax to access a property - so `Content.FirstName` instead of `Object.Attributes["FirstName"]["en"]` which would be necessary using the more advanced `IEntity` object
2. Ensure that the language used in retrieving a value is the current user language
3. Give conveniant access to related information like the `Presentation` object
4. Automatically handle some data-not-found errors
5. Automatically do conversions, like convert related entities (like `.Children`) into dynamic objects to make your code more consistant  

## Properties of a Dynamic Entity

Read the API docs in the [](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicEntity).

Additional properties that work (they are dynamic, so don't appear in the code)

1. **EntityType** _string_ - the type name like _Person_
1. **IsPublished** _bool_ - true/false if this item is currently published
1. **_AnyProperty_** _dynamic, but actually bool | string | decimal | datetime | List<DynamicEntity>_ any normal property of the content-item can be accessd directly. It's correctly .net typed (string, etc.)

> [!TIP]
> In 2sxc 10.27 any property that returns a `List<DynamicEntity>` now returns a [](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.DynamicEntityWithList). 
> This means that if you expect the list to just return one item, you can directly access its properties like this:  
> `Content.Author.FirstName`.  
> To otherwise enumerate the items, we recommend [](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Code.DynamicCode.AsList(System.Object)) so `AsList(Content.Tags)`

## Working with unpublished/draft items
TODO: write something about how-to-check if published/unpublished, navigating it, etc. - or link to such a page

## Appendix

The following properties/methods exist, but shouldn't be used. They are documented here so that you know that they are not meant for public use:

1. Created - the created date
2. Author - the person who created this item
3. Owner - the current owner of the item, usually the author
1. Metadadata - currently use `AsEntity(theObject).Metadata`
4. Permissions - permissions of the current item (if any are defined)
