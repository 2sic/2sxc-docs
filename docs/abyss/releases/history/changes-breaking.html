<p>We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API.
We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this.</p>
<p>👉 please also read about the <a class="xref" href="../management/policy-deprecate.html">Deprecation Policy</a></p>

<h2 id="breaking-changes-in-eav-and-2sxc-v20---moment-of-truth">Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v20 - Moment-of-Truth</h2>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>2sxc v20 is a milestone clean-up release, so it contains a lot of breaking changes.</p>
<p>This is the <strong>Moment of Truth</strong> where you see if you accidentally used internal or very old APIs.</p>
<p>These changes should only affect you, if you are accessing exotic/internal APIs,
or if you have some extremely old/deprecated code.</p>
<p>See also: <a class="xref" href="../management/policy-mot.html">MoT Policy (Moment of Truth)</a></p>
</div>
<p>Note that we marked the breaking changes like this</p>
<ul>
<li>⚠️ things which may affect you</li>
<li>⬇️ things which are extremely unlikely to affect you</li>
</ul>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Note that the focus of breaking changes is on the <strong>Razor</strong> code.
But there are also <a href="#breaking-formulas-api-changes">2 small breaking changes in <strong>Formulas</strong></a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Despite this being a breaking change, we want to emphasize that much of this is great news.
It removes a lot of old cruft, and cleans up some history such as &quot;SexyContent&quot;.</p>
<p>These changes only affect you, if you were doing some really nasty things, such as accessing the DB directly.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li><p>⚠️ All SQL tables and restructured - see <a class="xref" href="../../db/changes-v20.html">2sxc &amp; EAV Database Changes in v20</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>⚠️ In Dnn, the module is now installed in <code>/DesktopModules/ToSic.Sxc/</code> instead of <code>/DesktopModules/ToSic_SexyContent/</code><br>
This could affect you, if you had direct links to</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>$2sxc.min.js</code> file in your templates</li>
<li>were using the extremely old image resizer on the path <code>/DesktopModules/ToSic_SexyContent/Extensions/Thumbnailer.aspx</code><br>
🔨 see <a class="xref" href="v20/brc-thumbnailer.aspx/index.html">Fix Breaking Change Thumbnailer.aspx in v20</a></li>
<li>used one of the recommended base themes such as <strong>2shine</strong> and now quick-edit doesn't automatically appear on empty pages.<br>
🔨 see <a class="xref" href="v20/brc-dnn-quickedit-on-empty-page/index.html">Fix Breaking Change QuickEdit on Empty Page in v20</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>⚠️ In Dnn we stop auto-creating a <code>web.config</code> file in the <code>/2sxc/</code> folder, so Razor files will no longer automatically use the old base class <code>SexyContentWebPage</code>.
This should not affect you, you're installing old Apps in newer DNNs.<br>
🔨 see <a class="xref" href="v20/brc-automatic-base-class/index.html">Fix Breaking Change Stop Razor from Default to SexyContentWebPage in v20</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ The minimum Dnn version for v20 is now Dnn 9.11.02 (previously it was 9.6.1)<br>
This is because older DNNs have important security issues, and we want to force people to update.<br>
As of now, 2sxc v20 will still run on older DNNs, but we will not support it or test it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ The image resizer only includes the 64 bit binaries, the 32 bit binaries were removed.
This makes the distribution smaller, and I don't think anyone is using 32 bit servers anymore.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ All code was restructured to create smaller, more focused assemblies.<br>
This should not affect you, but if you were using some very old code, it may have been moved to a different assembly.
This can affect you if you were using compiled code which referenced the old assemblies (not common).</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ Most internal APIs were moved into <code>Sys</code> namespaces, so it's easier to see if you're using internal APIs.<br>
This should not affect you, unless you were already using internal APIs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ In Dnn, the modules name is now <code>2sxc</code> instead of <code>SexyContent</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-ientity-api-changes-razor">Breaking <code>IEntity</code> API Changes (Razor)</h3>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>If your code just used the normal DynamicEntity or TypedEntity / Items APIs, you are not affected by these changes.</p>
<p>But in rare cases, especially in older Apps, some workarounds were used to access the <code>IEntity</code> interface directly.</p>
<p>This is usually done by first running <code>AsEntity(someObject)</code> to get the <code>IEntity</code> underlying data.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li><p>⚠️ A very old interface <code>ToSic.Eav.Interfaces.IEntity</code> has been removed, please use <code>ToSic.Eav.Data.IEntity</code> instead.<br>
Some very old code may have used this to work around LINQ limitations.
Just use the new one, it's the same thing (but with fewer APIs, according to clean-up below).<br>
We've added some error handling to find out if this is the problem you have, and should lead you to this page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⚠️ <code>IEntity</code> has <code>object Get(name, ...)</code> and 2 special <code>Get&lt;TVal&gt;(...)</code> methods to get a value and convert it to <code>string</code>, <code>int</code> etc.
The special typed <code>&lt;TVal&gt;</code> variants were moved into extension methods.<br>
Normally this should not affect you, if you are <code>@using ToSic.Eav.Data</code> in your code, since it will just work.
If you did this is a more exotic way, add the <code>@using ToSic.Eav.Data</code> to your code, and it will work again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⚠️ <code>IEntity</code> had various <code>GetBestValue(...)</code> APIs which were removed.
We believe that about 2-3% of all code used this, so it may affect you.
🔨 see <a class="xref" href="v20/brc-getbestvalue/index.html">Fix Breaking Change drop old GetBestValue API in v20</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ APIs on <code>IEntity</code> were modified</p>
<ol>
<li><code>.Children(...)</code> and <code>.Parents(...)</code> now return <code>IEnumerable&lt;IEntity&gt;</code> instead of <code>List&lt;IEntity&gt;</code>.<br>
This will only affect you if you are using <code>.Count</code> on the result, in which case you should use <code>.Count()</code> instead.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ Old, deprecated APIs <code>IEntity</code> were removed.<br>
These have not worked properly for many years.<br>
We've added some error handling to find out if this is the problem you have, and should lead you to this page.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>object GetBestValue(string attributeName, bool resolveHyperlinks)</code> - didn't work for a long time, is being removed</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>TVal GetBestValue&lt;TVal&gt;(string name, string[] languages, bool resolveHyperlinks)</code> - didn't work for a long time, is being removed</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>object GetBestValue(string attributeName, string[] languages, bool resolveHyperlinks)</code> - didn't work for a long time, is being removed</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>object Value(string field, bool resolve = true)</code> - didn't work for a long time, is being removed</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>T Value&lt;T&gt;(string field, bool resolve = true)</code> - didn't work for a long time, is being removed</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ Some unofficial APIs on <code>IEntity</code> were removed</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>object PrimaryValue(string attributeName)</code><br>
The term <code>PrimaryValue</code> was an idea which we never pursued further. please just use <code>Get(...)</code> instead</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>TVal PrimaryValue&lt;TVal&gt;(string attributeName)</code><br>
The term <code>PrimaryValue</code> was an idea which we never pursued further. please just use <code>Get(...)</code> instead</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>object Value(string attributeName)</code><br>
The term <code>Value</code> was an idea which we never pursued further. please just use <code>Get(...)</code> instead</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>TVal Value&lt;TVal&gt;(string attributeName)</code><br>
The term <code>Value</code> was an idea which we never pursued further. please just use <code>Get(...)</code> instead</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ An API giving access to the ContentType Description <code>IContentType.Metadata.Description</code> were removed
We don't believe anyone used this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="other-breaking-razor-api-changes-dnn-only">Other Breaking Razor API Changes (Dnn only)</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>⚠️ The behavior to auto-load jQuery for very old Razor base classes was removed.<br>
A long time ago 2sxc accidentally loaded jQuery automatically in DNN.<br>
In those days, jQuery was used a lot. We stopped doing this for newer Razor base classes, but preserved the behavior for very old Razor base classes.<br>
This was removed in v20, so if you were using the old Razor base classes, you will need to add jQuery manually.<br>
<em>Note: code for this was commented out with <code>#RemovedV20 #OldDnnAutoJQuery</code>.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>⚠️ Three old APIs on old Razor Base classes such as <code>SexyContentWebPage</code> were removed. All have been deprecated since v12.<br>
They were originally meant to use the same Razor file to also create a WebApi and fill the DNN search index, but was deprecated a long time ago.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Purpose</code> - this was meant to tell Razor if it should prepare data for search or for view.</li>
<li><code>CustomizeSearch(...)</code> this was meant to customize the data for the search index. The functionality was moved to separate code many years ago.</li>
<li><code>CustomizeData(...)</code> this was a patchy way to specify the data for the razor template.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>⚠️ The <code>SexyContentWebPage</code> had a <code>List</code> property which provided <code>Element</code> objects to loop through.<br>
They were deprecated since v12, and replaced with the new Razor base classes which are much better.
If you were using these, please switch to the new Razor base classes and use the more modern approaches such as <code>MyItem</code>, <code>MyItem.Presentation</code>, <code>Content</code>, etc.
🔨 To fix, see <a class="xref" href="v20/brc-list-element/index.html">Fix Breaking Change List of Elements in v20</a>.
<em>Note: code for this was commented out with <code>#RemovedV20 #Element</code>.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ There is a <code>/system</code> folder in the DesktopModules which had extensions. Each could have a <code>.data</code> folder - this must now be <code>App_Data</code>.<br>
This is probably not an issue, as we will auto-rename this during the upgrade of v20.00.01</p>
</li>
<li><p>⚠️ Every App <em>can</em> have a similar <code>/system</code> folder. Each could have a <code>.data</code> folder - this must now be <code>App_Data</code>.<br>
This is rarely used, but you would have to manually rename this folder to <code>App_Data</code> if you had it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⚠️ DNN had some very old (pre v8) WebApi routes like <code>app-content</code>, <code>app-query</code> and <code>app-api</code> which were removed.<br>
If you had these in your code, please use the same route, just without the <code>app-</code> prefix.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ An old interface <code>ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.IRenderService</code> was removed, since it's been superseded by <code>ToSic.Sxc.Services.IRenderService</code>.
We believe it was used in 2-3 v12 Apps, so if you encounter this, just switch to <code>ToSic.Sxc.Services.IRenderService</code> instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ An internal interface called <code>ToSic.Sxc.Data.IEntityLight</code> was removed<br>
We don't believe anyone used this, but if you did, please use <code>ToSic.Eav.Data.IEntity</code> instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ A very old interface called <code>SexyContent.Interfaces.IDynamicEntity</code> was removed.<br>
If you really had this in your code, please use <code>ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicEntity</code> instead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ Some internal objects were consolidated, such as <code>IAttributeBase</code> which nobody should have used anyway<br>
We don't believe anyone used this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ lots of internal namespaces and classes/interfaces were renamed, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>DynamicEntity.GetEntityValue(string name)</code> (removed)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ An old API used by some of the first Mobius Apps used <code>App.Data.Cache.GetContentType</code>.<br>
This has been obsolete since v10 and is now removed in v20.<br>
We suggest you use a newer Mobius App or if you're really desperate, see 🔨 <a class="xref" href="v20/brc-list-iappdata-cache/index.html">Fix Breaking Change Removal of Cache on IAppData in v20</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ An old internal interface called <code>ToSic.SexyContent.IAppAndDataHelpers</code> was removed.<br>
It was implemented by <code>ToSic.SexyContent.Razor.SexyContentWebPage</code> and <code>ToSic.SexyContent.WebApi.SxcApiController</code>.
The APIs on it still work, but the interface was removed; you should not notice the clean-up.
See <a class="xref" href="v20/brc-dnn-files/index.html">Fix Breaking Change Dnn Files / Folders in v20</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-formulas-api-changes">Breaking Formulas API Changes</h3>
<h4 id="v1-formrunformulas-was-removed">V1 <code>form.runFormulas()</code> Was Removed</h4>
<p>The V1 formulas were not async, so they had a patchy solution for using formulas which requested data from the server.
The old solution was to use fetch and in the promise, call <code>form.runFormulas()</code> to retrigger the formulas after the data was loaded.</p>
<p>2sxc 16 in early 2023 introduced V2 formulas which can return a promise.
This will automatically trigger recalculations when the promise resolves,
and allows for better control over what happens (like if the same formula should run again, or not).</p>
<p>Since v16 was released, any use of the old <code>form.runFormulas()</code> resulted in a warning in the console.</p>
<p>In v20, this method was disabled showing a JS error.
If you were using it, please remove it and use the new V2 formulas instead.</p>
<h4 id="internal-formula-changes">Internal Formula Changes</h4>
<p>An internal API which placed some experimental commands in the formula calls were moved to the context.
Since it was only used internally, it should not affect anyone.</p>
<h3 id="other-changes">Other Changes</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>⬇️ Custom extensions (such as custom input fields) in the <code>/system</code> folder should place their data in the <code>/system/[ext-name]/App_Data/system-custom/</code> path.<br>
Previously the path <code>/system/[ext-name]/.data/</code> was also supported, but this is now removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ All <a class="xref" href="../../../basics/query/query-system.html">system queries</a> which are called <code>System.Whatever</code> previously also supported being called by <code>Eav.Queries.Global.Whatever</code>.<br>
This is now removed, so you should only use <code>System.Whatever</code> to call global queries.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ The <a class="xref" href="../../../net-code/conventions/dependencies/index.html">DependenciesClass</a> was previously called <code>MyServices</code> but it was very unclear, so it was renamed.  <code>ToSic.Eav.Data.IEntity</code>.<br>
This is a breaking change, but we don't believe anyone used this interface directly, except in custom DataSources - where we kept the old name for compatibility.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ The <code>IContentType</code> had a <code>.ContentTypeId</code> which should only be <code>.Id</code>. The old <code>.ContentTypeId</code> was removed (deprecated since v13).<br>
This is a breaking change, but we don't believe anyone used this property directly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ The <code>IContentType</code> had a <code>.StaticName</code> which should only be <code>.NameId</code>. The old <code>.StaticName</code> was removed (deprecated since v13).<br>
This is a breaking change, but we don't believe anyone used this property directly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ Previously the APIs <code>.Child(...)</code>, <code>.Parent(...)</code>, <code>.Children(...)</code>, and <code>.Parents(...)</code> on <code>ITypedItem</code> would return the related data without checking for publishing.
Now it will check for publishing and only show draft children/parents to editors (v20.00.03).<br>
This is a breaking change, but we don't believe draft-children were used much.</p>
</li>
<li><p>⬇️ The <code>ITypedItem</code> had a <code>.Dyn</code> property which was removed (v20.00.04).<br>
It was a temporary addition (and always marked as such) thought to help in migrating code.
But we're afraid people may use it and leave it in, so we decided it's best to completely remove it.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>⬇️ An interface called <code>ToSic.Sxc.DataSources.IBlockInstance</code> was removed since it was identical to <code>ToSic.Eav.DataSource.IDataSource</code> and should not be used anywhere.</li>
<li>⬇️ Core objects like Entity, Attribute etc. were changed to <code>record</code> - this would only affect you if you inherited from them</li>
<li>⬇️ Cleanup internal APIs on an internal interface <code>IEntityLight</code> which is not public. Properties: <code>Title</code>, <code>Attributes</code> and <code>this[...]</code></li>
<li>⚠️ Enhancement in the <code>Pages</code> DataSource - property renames <code>Visible</code> to <code>IsNavigation</code> and <code>Clickable</code> to <code>IsClickable</code></li>
<li>⚠️ Enhancement to the <code>Roles</code> DataSource - renamed to <code>UserRoles</code> - breaking change!</li>

<p>In v16.01 we had introduced a new Typed API, which turned out to be not good-enough.</p>
<p>This meant we had to rollback some of the changes we had introduced there,</p>
<h4 id="api-changes-which-should-really-not-affect-you">API Changes which should really not affect you</h4>
<ol>
<li>Various APIs which used to return an <code>IHybridHtmlString</code> now return an <code>IRawHtml</code><br>
This is to sync types with RazorBlade. It should have no effect on any code out there, as the result type is usually <code>dynamic</code></li>
<li>Renamed the type <code>ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicMetadata</code> to <code>ToSic.Sxc.Data.IMetadata</code><br>
This is technically a breaking change, but the type name should never have been used in any razor code, so it shouldn't affect anybody.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicField</code> to <code>ToSic.Sxc.Data.IField</code><br>
This is technically a breaking change, but the type name should never have been used in any razor code, so it shouldn't affect anybody.</li>

<ol>
<li>Base classes were renamed because of confusing ...Pro suffix. RazorPro is now RazorTyped, ApiPro is ApiTyped and CodePro is CodeTyped #3147</li>
<li>Now by default, all access to a property like .String(&quot;SomeName&quot;) will throw an error in required mode if the field doesn't exist #3138</li>
<li>The .Parents(...) was enhanced to require named parameters (see blog post) #3139</li>

<p>We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API.
We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>V12 did a lot of internal rework to get it to run on Oqtane. Almost none of the changes will affect you.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-change-version-1210">Breaking Change Version 12.10</h3>
<ol>
<li>Jquery is completely removed. This shouldn't affect your code, since all old code usually runs in DNN where jQuery is included by default.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-change-version-1205">Breaking Change Version 12.05</h3>
<p>V12 adds new properties to Razor and WebAPI which could result in some surprises: <code>Path</code>, <code>Convert</code>, <code>Settings</code>, <code>Resources</code> and <code>DevTools</code>.
Especially the new <code>Path</code> and <code>Convert</code> could clash with existing code which had <code>@using System</code> or <code>@using System.IO</code> so the code would just read <code>Path.GetFileName(...)</code> or something.
Because of this, we only give the latest classes <code>Custom.Dnn.Razor12</code>, <code>Custom.Dnn.Code12</code>, <code>Custom.Hybrid.Razor12</code>, <code>Custom.Hybrid.Api12</code> etc. these properties.</p>
<p>This means that previous base classes do not have these by design, and we encourage you to move to these latest base classes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Important: 2sxc 12.00 - 12.04 also had some of these properties on <code>ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent</code> as well as <code>ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController</code>.
So if you were eager to use these properties but didn't change the base class, you were able to use it.
To protect thousands of upgrade-scenarios we had to take them away from the old base classes. Sorry!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Possible Breaking Changes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>We believe nothing broke, but it could be that some commands on <code>EntitiesToDictionary</code> or <code>DataToDictionary</code> were accidentally changed. Pls report so we can fix that.</li>
<li>The <code>Link.To(...)</code> now returns safe URLs. This should not be an issue, but in rare cases post-processing of the string returned may expect spaces or something, which are now <code>%20</code></li>
<li>We disabled old obsolete APIs on the new Razor12, Api12 and Code12 base classes. In case you were using this (not likely) you'll get an error telling you about this.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-change-version-1204">Breaking Change Version 12.04</h3>
<ol>
<li>DynamicEntity now has a property Count because it's a list as well, this could cause issues if a content-type has a property <code>Count</code></li>
<li>DynamicEntity is now always a list. Because of this we removed the <code>DynamicEntityWithList</code> object. We believe the type is never referenced in user code, but if it is, this would be a breaking change.</li>
<li>Many parts that prepare Entities returned a <code>Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code> and now return an <code>IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code>.<br>
We believe this shouldn't hurt much, since the result would usually be in a <code>var</code> or returend directly to the API for streaming, but in case someone had used explicitly typed code, this will require a minor change</li>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>There were small breaking changes in 11.00 to 11.11 but they were internal so shouldn't affect normal developers.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-1107---drop-the-old-edit-ui">Breaking Changes Version 11.07 - Drop the old edit UI</h3>
<ol>
<li>In 11.07 the old edit UI was removed, so customizations for that UI would not be in effect any more.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-1110---mainly-dependency-injection">Breaking Changes Version 11.10 - Mainly Dependency Injection</h3>
<ol>
<li>In v11.10 we used much more dependency injection than ever before and stopped using static values which were still in the API in many places. Because of this, certain helper objects to create entities or lookup values were changed and their constructors were changed. We invested a lot of time to try to ensure that old APIs still work, but in case you're hit by one of these, make sure you check the DI and switch to resolving the objects using DI.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-1111---language-detection">Breaking Changes Version 11.11 - Language Detection</h3>
<ol>
<li>Previously the language detection used the Thread culture. Turns out this wasn't reliable because Dnn does some funny stuff (probably historical) which means that API-calls ended up using the language stored in some cookie instead of the one specified by the URL. We changed this, which should be more reliable. But if you were relying on this strange effect, then it may be a breaking change.</li>
<li>Internally our tokens were also using the thread culture. When we changed this, we also had to change how tokens pick up the language. In rare cases this may affect you.</li>
<li>We changed all tokens to always resolve boolean values to <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> (previously they would have been changed to the current language, like <code>wahr</code> for german). We believe this change is only an improvement, and should ensure that internal resolves in Queries etc. result in reliable output.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-1111---datasources-datasourceconfiguration">Breaking Changes Version 11.11 - DataSources: DataSourceConfiguration</h3>
<p>Note that we also improved the <code>DataSourceConfiguration</code> to an interface <code>IDataSourceConfiguration</code> and documented this.
As a side effect the API stays the same, but you will have to recompile your data sources for them to work again - sorry.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-111103---ientity-values">Breaking Changes Version 11.11.03 - IEntity Values</h3>
<ol>
<li><code>IEntity</code> had a command called <code>Value(fieldName)</code> which was probably never used. The idea used to be that it does language lookup internally, but we refactored this out since it could never be fully reliable because the full language list wasn't known to the <code>IEntity</code>. So we re-purposed the method (assuming it's not used) to just lookup the first occurance of the value. This way it`s useful for configurations and similar which are not multi-language.</li>
<li><code>IEntity</code> also had a <code>Value(fieldname, lookup)</code> method. We are deprecating it, and making the lookup not happen from now on. We believe it was never used.</li>
<li><code>IEntity</code> had a command called <code>PrimaryValue(fieldName)</code> which was probably never ever used, so we're deprecating it. Use <code>Value(fieldName)</code> instead.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-version-111103---other">Breaking Changes Version 11.11.03 - Other</h3>
<ol>
<li>UI Toolbar dropped the button and command for <code>item-history</code>, as the history is now part of the edit dialog</li>

<li>the internal interface <code>ToSic.SexyContent.IAppAndDataHelpers</code> was renamed to <code>ToSic.Sxc.IDynamicCode</code> but the old interface still exists, so it shouldn't break<br>

The Razor pages and WebApi have this starting now, while old terms still work.
Note that we're <em>not</em> creating a <code>HeaderPresentation</code>, because you should use <code>Header.Presentation</code></li>
