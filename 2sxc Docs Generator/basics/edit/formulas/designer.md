# Formula Designer

  .context-box-summary .browser-edit-ui { visibility: visible; }
</style>

In the Edit-UI you can always enter a Debug-Mode to develop / debug your formulas using real life data. 

## Enter Debug Mode

When the edit form is open, press **Ctrl + Alt + Shift** and click anywhere in the form. The debug bar should appear. If you have difficulties, use [this checklist](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/Lh88MFoT).

## Select Formula to work On

In the dialog you'll see dropdowns to select the entity, field and property. Things that already have a formula are bold:

## Debugging

It's easy to do additional debugging. For that please consult the [JavaScript Formulas Docs](xref:JsCode.EditForm.Formulas.Index)

## Missing Features

As of now the live-developer can only be used to work on the formulas, but you cannot save them from here. So after experimenting / developing you'll still need to copy-paste them manually to the Field-Settings.
