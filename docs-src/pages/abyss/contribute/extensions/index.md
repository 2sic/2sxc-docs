# Contribute to 2sxc / EAV Extensions

_Important: If you only want to USE 2sxc / EAV, then **you do NOT need this**. This is meant for people who want to contribute to the source code of 2sxc and EAV._

When we create extensions, we often need to document them, test them, and also create the code for them.
These internal guidelines should help us make sure we do it well.
