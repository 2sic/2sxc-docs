### Main Function $2sxc(...)

This is a object/function hybrid. So it is usually used like this:

```js
var sxc = window.$2sxc(moduleId);
```

The signature /parameters is the same as the [`$2sxc.get(...)`](xref:Api.Js.InPage.SxcGlobal.get) function.

The resulting object is a [Sxc](xref:Api.Js.InPage.Sxc)
