# Field Input-Type **entity**

The **entity** field is the base type for input-fields storing [entity-relationships](xref:Specs.Data.Values.Entity). It has sub-types.

## Features 
The basic **entity** field simply allows you to select items of a specific type, with various add/remove/create/delete features.  

## Sub-Types of Entity Fields

1. [entity-default](xref:Specs.Data.Inputs.Entity-Default) - standard selector with type, add/remove, one/multi, delete, etc.
1. [entity-query](xref:Specs.Data.Inputs.Entity-Query) for picking entities which were pre-processed in a query
