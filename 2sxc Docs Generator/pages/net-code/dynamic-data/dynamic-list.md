# Dynamic Entity Lists

It's very common to work with a list of items, like a list of blog posts, tags etc.

2sxc has a lot of magic under the hood to just make it work. Here's an example:

```razor
<ul>
@foreach(var tag in blogPost.Tags) {
  <li>@tag.Name</li>
}
</ul>
```

To get really good at coding lists, there are a few things you want to learn:

1. Use list from different sources
    1. Entities which are a property of something (like `blogPost.Tags`)
    1. Entities which belong to the Module
    1. Entities which come from a Query
    1. Entities of a specific Content-Type from App.Data
1. Difference between Entity-lists and DynamicEntity-Lists
1. Looping
1. Using LINQ to sort, filter and more

## Basics First - What Are Lists of Dynamic Entities

In the lingo of C# they are `IEnumerable<IDynamicEntity>` objects. 

> But basically lists are objects that can be stepped through (iterated).

You will usually use them to show the list of items (like a list of News items). 
And if the list has too much data or is in a weird sorting order, you'll usually want to filter and sort before doing this. 

## How to Get a List of Dynamic Entities

In many cases the list is aleady there for you to use. 
For example, if your `BlogPost` object has a property `Tags` which is an Entity-Picker in the Edit-UI, then this will automatically work:

```razor
<ul>
@foreach(var tag in blogPost.Tags) {
  <li>@tag.Name</li>
}
</ul>
```

In other scenarios you may get objects which are still IEntity objects. For example, `App.Data["BlogPost"]` will get you a list of `IEntity` objects.
But these don't allow you to just access a property, so you'll have to use `AsList(...)`.

```Razor
@* this won't work *@


```

1. Find some information


Whenever you create a content-type - like _Person_ - and want to work with the data in your C# Razor templates, you'll be working with a _Dynamic Entity_. 

ðŸ‘‰ also read about [](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.AsDynamic)

## Code example using a Dynamic Entity

We'll assume we have a _Content Type_ called *Book* with the following properties:
* **Title** (text, 1-line)
* **Teaser** (text, multi-line)
* **Description** (text, html)
* **ReleaseDate** (date)
* **Author** (entity - another content item)

Here's a code example in a C# Razor template:

```razor
<!--
  The default variable for the current item is Content, 
  we'll just use another name for this sample
  note that .Title is automatically provided, 
  because the content-type has the property title. 
-->
<h1>@Content.Title</h1>
<div>@Content.Description</div>
<div>Author: @Content.Author.FullName</div>
```
So basically all properties of this book can be shown using `[Object].[PropertyName]` - for example `Content.ReleaseDate`.

## What Dynamic Entity really does - and how...

Technically the dynamic entity object is like a read-helper for the more complex [](xref:ToSic.Eav.Data.IEntity). So actually the _dynamic entity_ object will keep a reference to the underlying read-only `IEntity` item on a property `Entity`, and whenever your code accesses a property, the dynamic entity will query it from the underlying `Entity`.

The main things that the _dynamic entity_ does for you, are

1. Give you a nice, short syntax to access a property - so `Content.FirstName` instead of `Object.Attributes["FirstName"]["en"]` which would be necessary using the more advanced `IEntity` object
2. Ensure that the language used in retrieving a value is the current user language
3. Give conveniant access to related information like the `Presentation` object
4. Automatically handle some data-not-found errors
5. Automatically do conversions, like convert related entities (like `.Children`) into dynamic objects to make your code more consistant  

## How the Property Lookup Works

Internally there are a few things that can returned if you do something like `Content.SomeProperty`

1. If the `SomeProperty` is one of the internal properties like `EntityId` etc. (see below) this will be returned
1. Topmost is a simple property of the underlying Entity, like `FirstName`
1. Similar to that are relationship properties, like `Tags` which will return a special DynamicEntity that behaves as a list (see below)
1. _if the entity is a list_ (for example the result of `var tags = Content.Tags`) then going deeper like `tags.Name` has the following behavior
    1. If the Tags-list had anything, then it will try to find a match on the first item according to these rules. _new in v10.27_
    1. If up till then nothing was found, it will check if any of the items in the list has that `Title` property. This lets you write `Tags.Webdesign.Name` _new in v12.04_
1. Last but not least - if nothing matches, it's `null`

## Properties of a Dynamic Entity

Read the API docs in the [](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicEntity).

Additional properties that work (they are dynamic, so don't appear in the code)

1. **EntityId** _int_
1. **EntityGuid** _Guid_
1. **EntityType** _string_ - the type name like _Person_
1. **IsPublished** _bool_ - true/false if this item is currently published
1. **_AnyProperty_** _dynamic, but actually bool | string | decimal | datetime | List<DynamicEntity>_ any normal property of the content-item can be accessd directly. It's correctly .net typed (string, etc.)

> [!TIP]
> In 2sxc 10.27 any property that returns a `List<DynamicEntity>` now returns a [](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicEntity) containing the list. 
> This means that if you expect the list to just return one item, you can directly access its properties like this:  
> `Content.Author.FirstName`.  
> To otherwise enumerate the items, we recommend [](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Code.DynamicCode.AsList(System.Object)) so `AsList(Content.Tags)`

## Working with unpublished/draft items

## Appendix

The following properties/methods exist, but shouldn't be used. They are documented here so that you know that they are not meant for public use:

1. Created - the created date
1. Modified - the modified date
3. Owner - the current owner of the item, usually the author
1. Metadadata - currently use `AsEntity(theObject).Metadata`
4. Permissions - permissions of the current item (if any are defined)
