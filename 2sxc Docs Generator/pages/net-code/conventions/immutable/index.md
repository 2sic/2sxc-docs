# Convention: Everything is Immutable

There are many programming paradigms.
One that's become very important to us is **immutable** programming.
This is strongly related to [functional APIs](xref:NetCode.Conventions.Functional)

This means than objects inside 2sxc are never modified.
Instead, they are copied and modified, and the original object is discarded.

## History

* Adopted into JS code ca. 2sxc 12
* Applied to a lot of server code in 2sxc 15
