## Writing Content

If you're new to wikis or github comments / documentation, you may be a bit lost when it comes to markdown.
I think the most important things you need to know are:

1. [Working with Markdown](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Markdown)
1. [Working with Images, Lightboxes and Galleries](xref:Abyss.Contribute.Docs.Images)

TODO: WORKING WITH TOC etc.
