# Settings Stack in 2sxc

[!include[](~/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .data-configuration { visibility: visible; }</style>

Settings come in 2 distinct flavors:

* **Standardized Settings** marked with ðŸ“‹ are edited in a content-type called `SystemSettings` with a predefined structure.  
  These settings are meant to be used across tools and apps.
* **Dynamic Settings** marked with ðŸ’ª use content-types which you define.  
  These settings can have any keys and values you want.  
  These will usually only affect a single App or a single Installation.  
  The code using these will usually come from you, as these settings are not standardized. 

Settings can be edited on many levels. The most general or fallback settings are presets in 2sxc. The most specific settings only apply to a specific view. 

In most cases your templates and code will simply want to get the most-relevant setting, no matter where it was configured. 
To make this possible, settings are treated as a stack. 
The most-relevant setting is top-most setting and is the one which will be used. 
So if a _View_ setting and a _Site_ setting have the same key, the _View_ setting will be preferred. 


The Settings are stacked in the following priority:

1. ðŸ’ª **View** - dynamic settings configured in the [View](xref:Basics.App.Views.Index) 
1. ðŸ’ª **App** - the dynamic `AppSettings` (see [AppSettings](xref:Basics.App.Settings)) of an [App](xref:Basics.App.Index) 
1. ðŸ“‹ **AppSystem** - The `SystemSettings` in the current [App](xref:Basics.App.Index) 
1. ðŸ’ª **Site** - an optional, manually created dynamic `Settings` on the **default Content App** of the current site
1. ðŸ“‹ **SiteSystem** - an optional `SystemSettings` in the **default Content App** of the current site, where the scope is set to Site
1. ðŸ’ª **Global** - an optional, manually created dynamic `Settings` on the **default System App**
1. ðŸ“‹ **GlobalSystem** - an optional `SystemSettings` on the **default System App**
1. ðŸ“‹ **PresetSystem** - the `SystemSettings` which are included in the installation of 2sxc

_Note that there is no setting called **ViewSystem** or **Preset** (without ...System) as these would make no sense._


Next we'll explain where you can configure settings for different effects / scopes.

## Global Settings which Affect All Sites

Global Settings for all sites are configured in the default System App. It's usually on Zone `1` and App `1`.

#### Global System Settings

To globally override system settings which are predefined by 2sxc:

1. go to the **default System App** 
1. On **Data** switch scopes to **Configuration**
1. Check if the ContentType `SystemSettings` already has an entry - if yes, edit that, if not, create a new one
1. To test the result, create a Razor file which accesses this setting in another Site or App. 

#### Global Custom Settings

To create own settings which are available globaly...

1. go to the **default System App** 
1. On **Data** switch scopes to **Configuration**
1. Check if the ContentType `Settings` exists - if not, create one
1. Check if the fields you need already exist, otherwise create them
1. To test the result, create a Razor file which accesses this setting in another Site or App. 

## Site Settings which Affect an Entire Site

These are configured in the **Content App** of the site you want to configure. 

#### Site System Settings

To override system settings which are predefined by 2sxc on a Site:

1. go to the **Content App** on the Site you want to configure
1. On **Data** switch scopes to **Configuration**
1. Check if the ContentType `SystemSettings` already has an entry - if yes, edit that, if not, create a new one
1. To test the result, create a Razor file which accesses this setting in another App on the same Site. 


#### Site Custom Settings

To create own settings which are are valid for this Site...

1. go to the **Content App** on the Site you want to configure
1. On **Data** switch scopes to **Configuration**
1. Check if the ContentType `Settings` exists - if not, create one
1. Check if the fields you need already exist, otherwise create them
1. To test the result, create a Razor file which accesses this setting in another App on the same Site. 


## App Settings which Affect an Entire App

These settings override previous settings but only for a specific App. 

#### App System Settings

To override system settings which are predefined by 2sxc on an App:

1. go to the **Content App** on the Site you want to configure
1. On **Data** switch scopes to **Configuration**
1. Check if the ContentType `SystemSettings` already has an entry - if yes, edit that, if not, create a new one
1. To test the result, create a Razor file which accesses this setting in another App on the same Site. 


#### App Custom Settings

To create own settings which are available on an App is a bit different, because this feature has existed long before the stack was invented.

## View Settings which Affect a specific View

#### View Settings which Override Global Settings

View Settings can also override Global Settings - but it's a bit harder to set up. This is because ViewSettings are always one custom Entity and doesn't come in the pairs used on App, Site or Global. 

We don't have time to document the exact steps, but in general you'll have to create an Entity-Field matching the name on the Global Settings and add an entity to it like the one used in Global Settigns. 

#### Custom View Settings

Just create a custom content-type in the **Configuration** scope and use it in the view.
