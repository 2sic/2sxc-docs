# Problems installing Apps with Hot Reload Enabled

When using Oqtane in **developer mode** there is a feature called **Hot Reload** which restarts Oqtane when files change. 

> [!WARNING]
> Installing Content-Templates and Apps with **Hot Reload** enabled causes problems.
>
> This is because the server will restart a few times during installation of the ZIP. 

Because of this you can only install Apps and Content-Templates if **Hot Reload is disabled**. 

After installation you can re-enable Hot-Reload as you see fit. 

## Checklist to Disable Hot Reload Temporarily
