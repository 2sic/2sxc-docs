# Roadmap of EAV and 2sxc - Vision of the Future

The 2sxc roadmap contains the things we think are fairly important to tackle next. Since we're all working for free, there is no commitment to do this in the order you see below. And sometimes a customer will need a feature quickly - and pay for it - then it will appear sooner. _You too can sponsor a feature!_

## Priorities we're Working on 2022 Q1 (V13)

### Done but maybe not fully documented

1. Improve Tutorials massively
1. View Metadata
1. Oqtane Website Mode which can be indexed in Google
1. Improve Feature-Management
1. IFeaturesService
1. Shared Apps across Sites
1. Enable editing of Shared Templates / files
1. Enable shared APIs
1. Language Editing Permissions based on roles/users
1. Disable translation of specific content-types
1. Dnn Factory replacement to render module or get DynamicCode outside of 2sxc
1. Fully integrate with Dnn Dependency Injection
1. Improve DI Scopes to Module-Level

### WIP

1. Enable viewing read-only data / configuration to better discover options/features
1. Patron-System, where sponsors of 2sxc get some extra features
1. Enterprise Features which will be availabe for bigger sponsors
1. IImageService
1. Standardize how to integrate into other systems (non-Dnn/Oqtane)
1. Provide more help UIs for using REST APIs
1. Make the Metadata-System completely discoverable
1. Update another ca. 5 Apps to the lastest/greatest conventions

## Priorities 2022 Q2

1. Note-feature to add notes to various things like entities, fields etc.
1. Provide Page-Level Metadata and Settings (outside of a specific App)
1. IToolbarService and ToolbarBuilder
1. Improve Formulas with Features
1. Blazor integration for use in client-side Blazor
1. Enterprise Lightspeed Cache

## V13


## Future / Other
* Support for persisting data to the file-system instead of DB
* Files DataSource
* ADAM DataSource
* Pages DataSource
* Navigation DataSource
1. Database re-organization ca. Dec. 2021
* ...or whatever is needed next :)
