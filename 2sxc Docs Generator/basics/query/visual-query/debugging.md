# VisualQuery

[!include[](~/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .query-app { visibility: visible; } </style>

In 2sxc 11.13 we're introducing a new feature called **Non-Breaking Errors**. 

Previously if there was an error in a Query, the entire query would fail and you would get a error message which was very difficult to debug. 

Now the system is much simpler. If any Stream has an error it will actually still provide a single Entity containing the error information. This looks like this:

<img src="./assets/stream-error-indicator.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

If you then click on the âš  you'll see the full message like this:

<img src="./assets/stream-error-details.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

## Security Considerations

Two things we're doing

1. All the error information is also logged into Insights, so super-users can check that for more details.
1. If the query blows on a normal user, the data will not contain any important information - so no paths, no internal values, etc.
1. If the query blows on the Super-User we'll sometimes include more information - like the Path to the CSV file
