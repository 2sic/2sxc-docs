_Help improve this documentation_

The core developers - mainly Daniel, Raphael and Benjamin - are investing a lot of time writing code, blogging and more. We simply don't have the resources to write all documentations as well, but if you help - it will be awesome! Please read the [Contribute](xref:Specs.DocsContribute) page first :).
