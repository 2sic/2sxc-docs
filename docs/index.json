    "keywords": "EAV / 2sxc / Dnn Architecture 2sxc is simple to use, but to enable that, it's pretty sophisticated on the inside. We'll give you an overview here, so you can better understand what you are using. Overall Architecture The Storage Systems This is fairly straight forward - data can be stored in SQL (spread across tables or using JSON) and the File System (stored as JSON). Note that assets like images are not handled here, but in the EAV-Apps layer (see below). The EAV Layer The data management system underneath everything is called the EAV - which stands for Entity, Attribute, Value. Anything in that namespace is about internal data models, reading/saving data etc. So anything inside the ToSic.Eav.Data is all about the internals, which you only need in special scenarios. The same applies to ToSic.Eav.Apps which is the sub-system responsible for combining data into virtual bundles called Apps. You can usually ignore this. The SXC Layer On top of the EAV layer we have the Sxc layer. It's responsible for Content Management on top of the App model provided by the EAV. The Sxc layer provides things like IDynamicEntity to let you code like @Content.Title. This is usually more interesting for you, but still fairly generic, because 2sxc is also meant to work with other platforms like NopCommerce, Orchard or Oqtane, but it hasn't been implemented yet. The Dnn Layer On top of the Sxc layer we have the Dnn layer. It connects 2sxc with Dnn. Usually when you're writing code and want to know about the API, you'll typically start here, and drill down to the other APIs as needed. Architecture of the EAV Layer Inside the EAV you'll find a whole ecosystem of parts which make the magic happen. Infrastructure This is very internal stuff, to make sure everything happens. You will usually not go here. Most if it is also not public API. Areas of interest may be the ToSic.Lib.Logging or ToSic.Eav.LookUp. Core Data Models This is more interesting and relevant to you, when you want to dive deep into the data model. Again you should note that this is advanced stuff. You'll find it in ToSic.Eav.Data - the most common bit you may care about is IEntity and IContentType. Data Processing This is where things get relevant for you. Check out the ToSic.Eav.DataSources to find all the bits and pieces used to process, filter and cache data. Storage This is still more an internal bit, and as of now you shouldn't use it. App System and Assets Another part that you may want to know more about. Here is where data is clustered together into virtual containers called Apps. These contain all the content-types and items of an App. It also has view-definitions, Content-Blocks (the logical unit usually called a Module in Dnn) and way more. You'll find it in ToSic.Eav.Apps. The assets - usually using ADAM - are found in ToSic.Eav.Apps.Assets. Web API This is ATM an internal section, mainly for connecting Dnn WebAPIs to the EAV. Not documented as of now. The Fine Line Between Eav.Apps and Sxc.* To keep the architecture clean, it's important to draw a clear line between Apps and what Sxc does. Basically it's this: Eav.Apps are virtual containers bundling things together. This means content-types, data, queries, settings, etc. Sxc is all about (Web) Content Management. So anything related to views, templates, assets, content-blocks is in Sxc. Specifically, these things may not be in Apps, and must be in Sxc Templates Rendering Engines like Token/Razor Content-Blocks Custom WebApi (which is also kind of a dynamic rendering engine)"

    "keywords": "2sxc CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) are the backbone of the internet. They are usually used to get common files from all over the universe such as: Fonts (icons, ...) JavaScripts (galleries, ...) CSS (bootstrap, ...) But they have a major problem: It's unclear which CDNs track users. This can cause major GDPR issues. For example, many fonts are provided by Google Fonts, which can get you into legal trouble with the EU. Here's a summary of the problems: Some CDNs are not GDPR compliant - or you simply don't know If you use CSP (Content Security Policy) you may have to whitelist many CDNs How 2sxc uses CDNs 2sxc is simple to install, use and customize. Part of this comfort is possible thanks to CDNs. For example, let's say you have multiple 2sxc Apps which use FancyBox (a cool JavaScript lightbox). 2sxc allows these Apps to just say \"I need Fancybox5\" using Kit.Page.Activate(\"Fancybox5\") and 2sxc will automatically get it from a CDN. The reason this is important, is because all parts of the page should use the same version of fancybox. Otherwise two Apps on the same page could break each other. So 2sxc has a list of standardized resources which are retrieved on demand when needed. These are loaded from CDNs by default - to keep the installation small. An admin can always modify this list to point to other locations, but it's hard work, and it's easy to miss something. In addition, the Edit UI and some Admin/Dev-UIs use CDNs to load large resources. The code editor uses Monaco (Visual Studio Code) which can be 20+ MB to download. Divide and Conquer the Problem To solve this, we had to figure out solutions for: efficiently get all the dependencies to create an own CDN create a 2sxc CDN with all important resources which is under our control allow others to use the resources to create their own CDN allow admins to point specific resources to their preferred location create global settings to automatically use a predefined CDN for everything (Patrons only) The 2sxc Resources Git Repo We created / scripted a Git Repository which contains all the resources we need. You can find it on https://cdn.2sxc.org/. You can use this as a starting point in case you yourself wish to create a CDN. As of now (v16.00 2023-05) it contains all the resources for public JavaScripts, css and fonts provided as Resources in 2sxc icons and fonts used in the Edit UI In future, we plan to extend it with resources used by other Admin UIs such as the code editor. cdn.2sxc.org Using the Git Repo, we created a CDN which is under our control. It's published as GitHub Pages on https://cdn.2sxc.org/. GitHub uses CloudFlare to distribute the pages, so it's fast and reliable. 💡 You can simply use this CDN for your own projects - we don't collect any data Create your own Custom CDN If you want to create your own CDN, you can simply fork the Git Repo and publish it on your own. You can also just keep the parts you need and copy them to your site, eg. to /cdn/. Quick-Configure Resources for Custom CDN The easiest way to do it is by using a simple setting in the UI like this: This is a Patrons Sentinel only feature. So if you want it fast, simple and fire/forget, just become a patron 🦸🏽‍♀️. Manually Configure Resources for Custom CDN If you want to do it manually, you can do it like this: Go to the resources management Select each resource you want to change and enter a different HTML block for these resources History Developed in 2sxc 15.04 for the public resources and Edit UI Released in 2sxc 16.00 LTS Shortlink: https://go.2sxc.org/cdn"

This is meant for people who want to contribute to the source code of 2sxc and EAV. Tip This is very new documentation and applies to 2sxc 16.06+ Concept 2sxc has a few git repositories, each with their own build process. But in general they all follow the same principles: When you compile a project, it will first compile the standard way, into the dist (JS) or bin (C#) folder The build process (WebPack or MSBuild) will then check the current folder and all parent folders for a file 2sxc-build.config.json to determine places which it should copy things to... If not found, it will use 2sxc-build-fallback.config.json which is located in the root of each repository - this is basically empty but should reference these docs. Use Cases Use Case 1: Build a Part and Copy Manually Let's assume you just got started and want to try something in partial project. You can just pull the repo, npm-ci everything and build. As a result you'll have the compiled JS in the dist folder and can manually copy it to folder of any DNN/Oqtane as you wish. Use Case 2: Build a JS Library and Copy to DNN/Oqtane Automatically In this scenario you would do the same as above, but in addition to that, create a 2sxc-build.config.json file in the repo folder with the specs. Use Case 3: Build Everything Automatically This is the scenario that the 2sxc team uses to build everything automatically. This is our folder structure: C:\\Projects\\2sxc the root folder C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\2sxc-build.config.json - The config file in our root c:\\Projects\\2sxc\\2sxc-dnn961.dnndev.me\\Website - our main DNN installation for verifying DNN 9.6.1 C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\Oqtane\\oqtane.framework\\Oqtane.Server - our main Oqtane installation for verifying Oqtane 4.x C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\2sxc - the main 2sxc C# repo C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\2sxc-ui - the 2sxc JS repo C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\eav-server - the eav C# repo C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\eav-ui - the EAV JS parts repo C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\InstallPackages the location where the final ZIP and NuGets are created And this is the 2sxc-build.config.json mentioned above: { \"JsTargets\": [ \"C:/Projects/2sxc/2sxc-dnn/Website/DesktopModules/ToSIC_SexyContent\", \"C:/Projects/2sxc/Oqtane/oqtane.framework/Oqtane.Server/wwwroot/Modules/ToSic.Sxc.Oqtane\", ], \"DnnTargets\": [ \"C:/Projects/2sxc/2sxc-dnn961.dnndev.me/Website\", ], \"OqtaneTargets\": [ \"C:/Projects/2sxc/oqtane/oqtane.framework/Oqtane.Server\", ], \"Sources\": [ \"C:/Projects/2sxc/2sxc-sources/_latest\", ], \"DnnInstallPackage\": \"C:/Projects/2sxc/InstallPackages/Dnn-Installer\", \"OqtaneInstallPackage\": \"C:/Projects/2sxc/InstallPackages/OqtaneModule\" } History New in 2023-09 v16.06 Shortlink: https://go.2sxc.org/build"

We separated these to make it easier to contribute to a specific part without worrying about the rest. If you only want to contribute to something small - like the languages / translations - then you only need to download that repository. In the complex scenarios each project can build into the other target, so if you want to work full-stack and use all of the automation, you will want to put everything in C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\. Contribute with Pull-Requests After you have made changes, you cannot just push the code back to our repo, since you probably won't have write permissions on the main repo. The correct procedure then is to fork the main repo into yours, and push into your own online repo. Then start a pull request, which we can then process. Setup Git Repos to use Use this checklist: GIT Branches We use the git-flow convention, and you should familiarize yourself with this, to properly work with the branches. As of now, the development-branch is called dev but we'll rename it to develop within the next few days. The EAV / 2sxc Server Solution Basically if you open the solution in the eav-server folder, it will open all the EAV server (C#) code and 2sxc code in Visual Studio. This is very important, because if you build anything extensive and rename anything, it guarantees that everything is correctly updated. The 2sxc UI This extends the EAV-UI with more field types, adds configuration and also adds a lot of other JS. if you run the gulp develop it too will auto-build and copy to the live Dnn / 2sxc site."

About the Markdown Syntax If you're new to wikis or github comments / documentation, you may be a bit lost when it comes to markdown. I think the most important things you need to know are: Headers have 1-6 hashes in front, like ## Header 2 bold uses two * chars around the text, _italic_ uses one _ char, escaping chars uses the \\ slash (so any character right after a \\ is shown and doesn't format) Linking has many options, better read the manuals Lists have many options, better read the manuals Images use a ![alt-text](/assets/path/file.ext) syntax Note that line-breaks usually don't cause a line-break in the result (except in code-samples). You can enforce a simple line break by adding two spaces at the end of a line like \"check out: \" (two spaces after the \":\") Inline code starts and ends with a \"`\" character - like `code` - it will then look like code Multi-line code blocks start with three of these, like ``` var x = 17; // a comment ``` resulting in var x = 17; // a comment Multi-line code with syntax highlighting needs you to specifiy the language c#: ```c# var x = 17; // a comment ``` resulting in var x = 17; // a comment Pre-Requisites Before beginning with the documentation process, ensure that you have set up the complete 2sxc/EAV development environment. This environment should be configured and functional for the development of C# and JavaScript code. For more information on this setup, please refer to the Code documentation. The documentation tool we use is docfx, which needs to be installed on your development machine. You can install it using the following command: dotnet tool install -g docfx Install node modules for npm tasks: cd \"C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\2sxc-docs\\2sxc Docs Generator\" npm ci Getting Started The documentation development takes place in this 2sxc-docs GitHub repository. The documentation is generated from *.yml and *.md files and 2sxc/EAV's C# and JavaScript source code. The npm task import is an optional step, used only when there is a need to prepare JavaScript-related files for inclusion in the documentation. To execute this task, navigate to the 2sxc Docs Generator directory and run the import task with npm. Here are the necessary commands: cd \"C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\2sxc-docs\\2sxc Docs Generator\" npm run import This command will execute the import task defined in your package.json file, preparing your 2sxc JavaScript related files for documentation generation. To build and run your local version of the documentation, follow these steps: cd \"C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\2sxc-docs\\2sxc Docs Generator\" docfx build docfx.json --serve Once the documentation server is running, you can access it via your web browser at http://localhost:8080. Configuration The docfx.json file is the configuration file for DocFX. It specifies how to generate documentation from your code and Markdown files. Our docfx.json file is configured to generate documentation from C# project files and pre-parsed JavaScript files, build documentation pages from Markdown and YAML files, copy resource files to the output directory, use overwrite files to provide additional metadata, and use multiple templates to define the layout of the documentation pages. The built documentation is saved to the ../docs directory. Here's a breakdown of our docfx.json file: \"metadata\": This section is used to configure the metadata extraction process. It specifies the source files to extract metadata from, the destination to save the extracted metadata, and other options that are necessary to compile cs projects using MSBuildWorkspace. \"build\": This section is used to configure the documentation build process. It specifies the source files to build documentation from, the destination to save the built documentation, and other options. \"content\": This subsection specifies the source files to build documentation from. Each item in the array specifies a set of files and options for those files. \"resource\": This subsection specifies the resource files to copy to the output directory. Resource files are typically non-documentation files that are used by the documentation, such as images. \"xref\": This subsection specifies the cross reference map files to use. Cross reference map files provide information about how to link to items in other projects. \"overwrite\": This subsection specifies the overwrite files to use. Overwrite files provide additional metadata for items in the documentation. \"dest\": This key specifies the destination directory to save the built documentation. \"template\": This key specifies the templates to use for building the documentation. Templates define the layout of the documentation pages. \"cleanupCacheHistory\": This key specifies whether to clean up the cache history. \"disableGitFeatures\": This key specifies whether to disable Git features. \"globalMetadata\": This subsection specifies global metadata that is available to all documentation pages. Templates DocFX uses templates to transform the structured data model into the final static website. It is configured in 2sxc Docs Generator\\docfx.json in the template section: \"template\": [ \"default\", \"statictoc\", \"material/material\", \"templates/2sxc\" ], It has a few pre-defined templates, including: default: This template contains the basic layout of a website, including the home page, table of contents, and other necessary parts of a website. statictoc: This template generates a website with a static table of contents. material/material: It is a modern material template with a responsive design. We also created 2sxc custom templates for DocFX in 2sxc Docs Generator\\templates\\2sxc composed of several parts: Transformers in templates\\2sxc are responsible for transforming the data model into another data model. They are written in JavaScript and are used to transform the data model into another format. Templates in partials folder define how to render the data model into the final document. They are responsible for generating the HTML from the data model. The placeholders (like {{title}}) are written in Mustache, a logic-less templating language. They are replaced with actual values from the data model when DocFX generates the documentation. Styles in styles folder are written in CSS and are used to style the final document. Renderers in styles folder are responsible for rendering the data model into the final document. They are written in JavaScript and are used to render the data model into other formats, such as HTML. More info: Introduction to the DocFX Template System. How-to: Create A Custom Template Troubleshooting To verify whether docfx can successfully build the documentation, use the following command: cd \"C:\\Projects\\2sxc\\2sxc-docs\\2sxc Docs Generator\" docfx The successful execution of this command should display the message: Build succeeded. If docfx encounters an error when building a .NET project, you can manually attempt to build the project. This allows you to get more information about the error and address it. You can do this with the following commands: cd c:\\Projects\\2sxc\\2sxc\\Src\\Dnn\\ToSic.Sxc.Dnn dotnet build Upon successful execution, you should see the message: Build succeeded.

It then contains a ContentType node containing various identification and description optional Content-Type Metadata attributes (array) - often with attribute Metadata note that the attribute order is relevant Example This example is an extract of the Config Content-Type to manage the SqlDataSource (will be releasen in 2sxc 9.8 with more help-text etc.): { \"_\": { \"V\": 1 }, \"ContentType\": { \"Id\": \"|Config ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SqlDataSource\", \"Name\": \"|Config ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SqlDataSource\", \"Scope\": \"System\", \"Description\": \"todo\", \"Attributes\": [ { \"Name\": \"Title\", \"Type\": \"String\", \"IsTitle\": true, \"Metadata\": [ { \"Id\": 0, \"Version\": 1, \"Guid\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\", \"Type\": { \"Name\": \"@All\", \"Id\": \"@All\" }, \"Attributes\": { \"String\": { \"DefaultValue\": { \"*\": \"Sql Query\" }, \"InputType\": { \"*\": \"string-default\" } }, \"Boolean\": { \"VisibleInEditUI\": { \"*\": true } } } } ] }, { \"Name\": \"ConnectionGroup\", \"Type\": \"Empty\", \"IsTitle\": false, \"Metadata\": [ { \"Id\": 0, \"Version\": 1, \"Guid\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\", \"Type\": { \"Name\": \"@All\", \"Id\": \"@All\" }, \"Attributes\": { \"String\": { \"DefaultValue\": { \"*\": \"\" }, \"InputType\": { \"*\": \"empty-default\" } }, \"Boolean\": { \"VisibleInEditUI\": { \"*\": true } } } } ] }, { \"Name\": \"ConnectionStringName\", \"Type\": \"String\", \"IsTitle\": false, \"Metadata\": [ { \"Id\": 0, \"Version\": 1, \"Guid\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\", \"Type\": { \"Name\": \"@All\", \"Id\": \"@All\" }, \"Attributes\": { \"String\": { \"DefaultValue\": { \"*\": \"SiteSqlServer\" }, \"InputType\": { \"*\": \"string-default\" } }, \"Boolean\": { \"VisibleInEditUI\": { \"*\": true } } } } ] }, ... { \"Name\": \"SelectCommand\", \"Type\": \"String\", \"IsTitle\": false, \"Metadata\": [ { \"Id\": 0, \"Version\": 1, \"Guid\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\", \"Type\": { \"Name\": \"@All\", \"Id\": \"@All\" }, \"Attributes\": { \"String\": { \"DefaultValue\": { \"*\": \"/****** Script for SelectTopNRows command from SSMS ******/\\r\\nSELECT TOP (1000) PortalId as EntityId, HomeDirectory as EntityTitle\\r\\n ,[PortalID]\\r\\n ,[ExpiryDate]\\r\\n ,[AdministratorRoleId]\\r\\n ,[GUID]\\r\\n ,[DefaultLanguage]\\r\\n ,[HomeDirectory]\\r\\n ,[CreatedOnDate]\\r\\n ,[PortalGroupID]\\r\\n FROM [Portals]\\r\\n Where ExpiryDate is null\" }, \"InputType\": { \"*\": \"string-default\" } }, \"Boolean\": { \"VisibleInEditUI\": { \"*\": true } } } }, { \"Id\": 0, \"Version\": 1, \"Guid\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\", \"Type\": { \"Name\": \"@string-default\", \"Id\": \"@string-default\" }, \"Attributes\": { \"Number\": { \"RowCount\": { \"*\": 10.0 } } } } ] } ... ], \"Metadata\": [] } } Details about the Format The format is currently in version 1, and looks like this: _ this is the header - containing the version, in case we introduce breaking changes in the future - see also format v1 ContentType - this is the content-type Id - internal identifier, also known as the static name - often a GUID Name - a nicer name Scope - a term which groups types together; mainly for hiding types the user should normally not see Description - a short description for internal use Attributes [array] [item] Name - the field-name Type - the primary type, like string, number, etc. Description - a short description IsTitle - is this the title field (there must always be one title field) Metadata [array] with more information about this field/attribute - see Metadata Metadata [array] with more information about the content-type - see Metadata Specials about the JSON Content-Types ID is not always a GUID The ID is usually a GUID, but for special system types it is not. This is mostly historic, as all new content-types will have GUIDs, but old types still exist in the system which have a nice name, but that's not ideal for various use cases. This corresponds to the StaticName in the C# API. Scope is Like a Virtual Group The Scope is a name - usually System or something like that. It's primarily used to group types together, so that the editor doesn't have to see the ca. 50 types in the background which make the solution work. See Content-Type Scopes Content Types Have Metadata Content-types can have a lot of metadata - also mostly for the UI. An example is the help-text which is shown. This too is stored as normal JSON. See JSON Metadata V1. Attributes Have Metadata Each attribute - let's say a field \"Color\" has more information which is needed for scenarios like the edit-UI. These items are standard Metadata. Content Type Attributes must preserve Sort Order This is important, as it's relevant to the UI. Limitations As of now (2sxc 9.7) the system will pick up the content-types stored there and everything works. BUT there is no built-in mechanism to edit these. We (2sic) can easily create content-types in a normal 2sxc and export them to json for this purpose, but as of now there is no GUI to do so. This should not affect you, as it's not meant to be managed by anybody else than us as of now.

Since then it has found many new applications. JSON Package The Json format has a minimal header like this: { \"_\": { \"V\": 1 } } which just contains the version. Future non-breaking enhancements will leave the version on 1 and optionally add more header information. In addition to that, the basic package can contain ContentType node an Entity node a Query - which is actually also an Entity with lots of Metadata a View - which is an Entity with Metadata and Assets This could then look like this: { \"_\": { \"V\": 1 }, \"ContentType\": { \"Id\": \"|Config ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SqlDataSource\", \"Name\": \"|Config ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SqlDataSource\", ... } } Special Stuff about the JSON Format All values have language information As we're usually working with real-life content-items, multi-language is always a concern. Because of this, every value is multi-language by default. If the language code is *, that means that this value is the default/fallback value for all languages. See JSON Value (Multilanguage) V1 Metadata is a Recursive List of Entities 2sxc and the EAV is all about real-life content-management. As such, many pieces of information have more information attached, called Metadata. Metadata-items could themselves have their own Metadata, which is then of course attached as well.

Purpose Our goal is to enable central attribute definitions. This will allow a content-type to specify all attributes incl. configuration and help texts. Other ContentTypes can then have fields which share the definition of the original. Challenges Sharing Mark attributes which are meant for sharing (to ensure only these are shared) Restrict how far the sharing goes - to better restrict what is possible and to avoid unwanted side-effects (eg. current App only) Possibly restrict what parts are shared / can be inherited Probably minimal setup for sharing: { \"Share\": true } Future: Probably advanced setup for sharing outside of current App { \"Share\": true, // required for sharing // The following are currently not implemented \"ShareRestriction\": \"Site\", // optional, restrict sharing to this level, optional, defaults to \"Scope\" = \"Current App, Current Scope\" \"ShareOnly\": \"Metadata\", // optional, by default everything that can be shared is shared, this would restrict it to only share the metadata } Inheriting Mark Attributes to indicate that their identity is the the same as another field Mark Attributes to indicate they inherit something (eg. the Metadata) Possibly exact control over what is inherited (eg. all specs, only certain specs etc.) Possibly inherit from multiple attributes (eg.

    "keywords": "Your Custom Platform - Scenario #1 - Read EAV Data This is part of the Integration Guide for integrating EAV or 2sxc into your own solution. Tip You can find this fully implemented in the Integration\\BasicEav01 project. Search for #2sxcIntegration in the code to find all the things that were adjusted to get it to work. Scope of Scenario #1 - Read EAV Data In Scenario #1 we will setup a basic system. This is the foundation for more enhanced scenarios. Functionality Can read / get EAV Data from an existing Dnn or Oqtane Database Has a dummy IUser implementation which says the user is always a SystemAdmin Can see Insights to see what's happening internally and to verify everything is ok Integration Overview for Basic Read-From-Existing-DB Scenarios To Integrate EAV and 2sxc into your system, these are the core things you must do: Add necessary DLLs Copy all relevant files core files like App_Data Integrate into your Dependency Injection Do StartUp configuration as needed Test / Verify you can Read Data 1. Add Minimal DLLs For the first scenario, we need the main ToSic.Eav.* DLLs (no 2sxc DLLs needed): Apps Core DataSources ImportExport Persistence.Efc Repository.Efc You can add these manually, reference them or whatever. 2. Copy Important Data to Your Target The EAV loads important data from the file system when it starts. This data contains Content-Types and basic configuration which is necessary to work. In the basic implementation, you need the App_Data folder to be copied to the right location, which must be available at runtime. Tip The App_Data folder does not need to be accessible from outside. You may copy the App_Data manually, or automate it on build. The following script is used in the BasicEav01 project on build (adjust it to your needs): @Echo Configuration='$(Configuration)' @Echo StartWith ='$(Configuration.StartsWith('Debug'))' @Echo Platform ='$(Platform)' @Echo ProjectDir '$(ProjectDir)' @SET BuildTarget=$(ProjectDir)sys-2sxc @Echo BuildTarget '%BuildTarget%' @REM Copy the data folders robocopy /mir \"$(ProjectDir)..\\..\\Data\\.data\\ \" \"%BuildTarget%\\.data\\ \" 3. Integrate into your Dependency Injection The EAV and 2sxc need Dependency Injection to work. As of now (2022-02) we use the .net Standard 2.1 DI. Note The example below also registers the IntUser which is the Integration-implementation of the IUser. To see the code of that, just check out the example code in the project. 3.1 General Principles The general principle is as follows: At StartUp you'll either use the existing IServiceCollection like in the Oqtane examples or create a new ServiceCollection() like in the Dnn examples You'll later have custom services for your platform only, these should be added in an own method like AddSxcYourPlatform in your own static class Once you need these objects, you'll get a IServiceProvider from the framework or create your own, sometimes creating an own scope This would be a minimal StartUp taken from BasicEav01: /// <summary> /// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container. /// </summary> public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { // #2sxcIntegration // Register our Always-Super-User (to allow Insights to be used) services.TryAddTransient<IUser, IntUser>(); // Enable all of EAV services.AddEav(); // RazorPages - standard .net core MVC feature services.AddRazorPages(); } 3.2 Various DI Scenarios Your project may already use DI, or it may not. Here are the common scenarios you will probably have: 3.2.1 DI Scenario #1 - No Dependency Injection This scenario is common in classic .net Framework and WebForms projects which are a bit older. We assume nobody will actually be needing this much, so we won't explain this in detail. Your work will basically consist of At Startup, create a new DI and store it somewhere (see DNN samples to see how this can be done) When you use it, make sure you get the IServiceProvider - probably in an own Scope per request and module 3.2.2 DI Scenario #2 - .net Core Dependency Injection This scenario is common in new Asp.net Core projects. It already has Dependency Injection setup, and all you need to do is use the existing one. For this scenario, best see how it's done in Oqtane 4. Do StartUp Configuration Some aspects of EAV & 2sxc are super important that they are configured before anything starts. These are the required ones as of 2022-02: The database ConnectionString required to connect to the EAV DB GlobalFolder of the distributed 2sxc files containing things like the App_Data subfolder - required to load initial configurations and initial data Call StartUp on the SystemLoader which you must get from DI This is the working code taken from BasicEav01: /// <summary> /// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline. /// </summary> public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ----- Start EAV stuff #2sxcIntegration ----- var serviceProvider = app.ApplicationServices; // Set Connection String serviceProvider.Build<IDbConfiguration>().ConnectionString = _connStringFromConfig; // Set global path where it will find the .data folder var globalConfig = serviceProvider.Build<IGlobalConfiguration>(); globalConfig.GlobalFolder = Path.Combine(env.ContentRootPath, \"sys-2sxc\"); // Trigger start where the data etc. will be loaded & initialized serviceProvider.Build<SystemLoader>().StartUp(); // ----- End EAV stuff #2sxcIntegration ----- // ... } 5. Test and Verify If you did everything right, you can now run your code and access data from the App Cache using code like this (see demo on the ShowEavData.cshtml): @page @using ToSic.Eav.Apps @inject IAppStates AppStates @{ ViewData[\"Title\"] = \"First Read Data from EAV\"; // Adjust these values to your testing environment var zoneId = 2; var appId = 78; var appState = AppStates.Get(new AppIdentity(zoneId, appId)); var firstItem = appState.List.FirstOrDefault(); } Common Problems If the folder to the App_Data isn't quite correct, you will have a long loading time and then a stack overflow 5. Get Insights WebApi to Work The Insights will help you figure out what parts you need to implement. It will show you what services were requested which are not implemented yet, and will show you what code was used. Create your minimal InsightsController as you see in the demo project Register the routes using whatever system you have ATM (.net core, ASP.net Framework) Test the routes to see things are coming out Minimal InsightsController You can review the code of the InsightsController in the Controllers folder in the project. It's basically just a simple controller with one Details(...) action. Activate it in the StartUp.cs public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => { endpoints.MapRazorPages(); // #2sxcIntegration - enable insights controllers endpoints.MapControllers(); }); } Test by calling https://localhost:44384/api/sxc/sys/Insights/Help - replace the base path as needed. Tip Once the insights work, you can also see what objects were used in a fallback/unknown implementation.

Tip You can find this fully implemented in the Integration\\SxcEdit01 project Search for #2sxcIntegration in the code to find all the things that were adjusted to get it to work. Warning These docs are still WIP. Scope of Scenario #2 - Edit EAV Data Functionality A link on a page can open the edit dialog Users can edit texts Users can save the result Users can see the history of an item and restore it to a previous state ADAM Users can upload assets in the edit-dialog - which is stored in this new web (not in the original Dnn/Oqtane) Users can see previously uploaded assets Users can delete and rename assets in the edit-dialog Assets are referenced using their path, not an ID (which would be the default in Dnn/Oqtane) Adam files of an entity can be shown on a page All API Controllers log what they do Not implemented Security checks are fake, it always returns that edit etc. is allowed Integration Overview for Basic Edit + ADAM To Integrate EAV and 2sxc into your system, these are the core things you must do: Add more necessary DLLs Copy additional relevant files - specifically the js/css files to be used in the dialogs Implement core objects which are different in your system Implement APIs for edit, probably also for delivering files etc. Test / Verify you can edit data 1. Add Minimal DLLs For this scenario you need to add just about all of the DLLs except for Razor helpers. You can add these manually, reference them or whatever. 2. 2sxc Web Files (JS, CSS) 2.1 Copy Important Web Files to Your Target All the dialogs are JS based, so you must get these JS files in a place where they can be loaded. Tip The dist, js folders etc. must be accessible from outside. For reference, check out the build script on the SxcEdit01 project. 2.2 Make sure in page 2sxc JSs are loaded For the page to be able to trigger edit dialogs, it needs at least these two files to be loaded on the page when a user should be able to edit: [2sxc public files root]/js/2sxc.api.min.js - note that the location could change in a future version [2sxc public files root]/dist/inpage/inpage.min.js - note that the location could change in a future version Optional: Load the CSS [2sxc public files root]/dist/inpage/inpage.min.css for Toolbars to work 2sxc does this automatically in a full implementation like in Dnn and Oqtane. The logic to do that and ensure it's part of the final output is sophisticated. So for this minimal implementation, best do it yourself, and choose yourself if you give it to all users or just admins. 2.3 Give the JS Environment Variables The JS needs to know a few global things for it to work. At the minimum it's the location of the WebAPI root as well as the location of the UI files. For this you either need a _jsApi meta header or add this to the page after the $2sxc-js has been loaded: $2sxc.env.load({ // optional pageId: 0, rvt: '@IntegrationConstants.EnvRvt', api: '@IntegrationConstants.EnvApiRoot', uiRoot: `@IntegrationConstants.EnvUiRoot`, }); The previous code was taken from the _Layout.cshtml in the example. 3. Implement Core Objects which are Necessary Specifically Implement Context\\ISite is needed to have information about the ContentPath Context\\IUser is needed to pretend it's a super-user and allow editing Adam\\IAdamPaths - our test-case assumes it's in wwwroot, for which there is already a prepared AdamPathsWwwroot object Register these replacements in the StartUp - in the demo project it's in the StartupEavAndSxc.AddImplementations(...) 4. Implement and Activate WebApis Implement a base class to assist in various aspects Add the request to the insights logs Ensure timing of the request to better spot issues Make sure your controllers are just proxies calling the Real controller Make some minor corrections to HTTP responses, so empty ones really return an HTTP 204 Implement WebApis to answer on the appropriate endpoints (see examples) DialogController is required to get general information for dialogs to work EditController is reponsible for loading and saving data from the dialog AdamController helps with file uploads etc. Register / activate Depending on the framework, registration is different. For .net core, check out the example AddControllersAndConfigureJson(...) or the Oqtane registration examples. Remember that it must also be configured - see the UseEndpoints(...) or the Startup.cs 5. Provide index-raw.html On the / new v14 The 2sxc dialogs (quick-dialog and eav-edit) both create an index-raw.html. These are incomplete - they need some placeholders to be replaced at runtime based on the page they are opened from. Linking to these UIs happens through these targets: [2sxc public files root]/dist/quickDialog/?pageId=123&sxcver=14... [2sxc public files root]/dist/ng-edit/?pageId=123&sxcver=14... You must ensure that these URLs deliver the corresponding index-raw.html with the placeholders fixed. For this, either create a real page (like a default.aspx in DNN) which responds to the request and renders the index-raw.html with the placeholders replaced. Or you can create a route/endpoint (like in Oqtane) which does the same thing. Best check the code how it's done in Dnn/Oqtane. The placeholders which are currently set are: @base - for the base-tag containing the page-id so that refreshes preserve this @jsapi - the meta-header containing context information @sxcver - for the version of 2sxc extended with the server-start timestamp, mainly for cache-break purposes <!--@customheaders--> - custom headers - ATM not used but you may need it <!--@custombody--> - custom body - ATM used by Oqtane to provide the Request Verification Token These are replaced automatically for you when you use the ToSic.Sxc.Web.HmlDialog helpers. 6. Expand StartUp Configuration Do the same as TODO: Some aspects of EAV & 2sxc are super important that they are configured before anything starts. These are the required ones as of 2022-02: The database ConnectionString required to connect to the EAV DB GlobalFolder of the distributed 2sxc files containing things like the App_Data subfolder - required to load initial configurations and initial data Call StartUp on the SystemLoader which you must get from DI This is the working code taken from BasicEav01: /// <summary> /// This method gets called by the runtime.

This can reduce module rendering time by up to 99% and reduce page load time by 50-90%. How it Works Basic Principles of 2sxc LightSpeed Internally every module is rendered into a package containing the final HTML as well as changes to the page, such a title adjustments, CSP headers to add etc. When LightSpeed is enabled, this package will be cached. But it a very smart way: The cache is by user, so logged in users would always get their own cache. Anonymous users all get the same cache. Depending on LightSpeed settings on the app, the cache can vary by URL parameter, and optionally be case-sensitive. Since we cache both the final HTML as well as page changes like headers, we can reliably reproduce everything on future requests. This setup covers 99% of all use cases. For further optimizations, please contact us so we can enhance the API. Cache Flushing and Invalidation The cache will automatically flush if any of these things happen: any data is edited on an app any file in the app-folder is changed In these two cases all modules of that app are flushed. This ensures that no matter what you do, the cache is always up to date. How to Enable 2sxc LightSpeed Enable the 2sxc LightSpeed Feature Important: You must be a 2sxc Patron with the Patron Perfectionist package to use this feature. This is what you would probably see if your system is not yet registered: Make sure you have 2sxc 13.10+ installed Register your site and activate the Patron Perfectionist package Activate the license on your site so the package is available This is what you should see once you are ready. This will activate LightSpeed but nothing will be cached yet, unless you have Apps which already have a LightSpeed configuration. You can use the toggle to turn LightSpeed off in case something causes trouble. Configure 2sxc LightSpeed for your App To start caching, you must configure it in each app. This happens in the App Metadata. If you don't see the menu shown on arrow #2, then you have not activated the feature yet. This is what each setting does: Enable: you can change this for each app, espcecially while testing Duration: this is the normal duration for anonymous users Duration...: other durations for other users - we suggest that you only set it for anonymous users and admins URL Parameter: if not set, the cache stays the same even if url parameters change for Content and other simple things which don't have logic, this is recommended, but for list/details setups you need to enable this Case Sensitive: if set, url changes will be case sensitive Tip We suggest you also activate this for Site-Admins and System-Admins, as these will enjoy editing the site more. Since the cache will be flushed on every edit, this should not be a problem. After saving you should see something like this: We've made sure that the title contains a summary of all settings, so it's easy to see the configuration. LightSpeed Configuration Overview At the Apps-Management dialog you can see the status for each app. You can see if it's enabled or not You can also see the details if you hover on the icon You can also click on the ⚡ to quickly make some changes Verify It Works Verify LightSpeed Works in Chrome We suggest you use an anonymous browser (not logged in) to verify it works. In a separate logged-in browser you can enable/disable LightSpeed. If you refresh the page, you should see a much faster response time if LightSpeed is enabled: Verify LightSpeed Works in 2sxc Insights You can also review module loading time in 2sxc Insights. Here is an example showing the first load time and cached load times: Important Module load time is just for one module. The page can contain many modules and will also need 50-100ms for DNN / Oqtane work. Common Issues Here are some things that can cause trouble when activating the Lightspeed feature: Details Pages all Show the Same Content Details pages usually have a ?id=xxx or similar parameter to identify the item to show. The cache must know that each url must be cached separately so you must configure this in the App Metadata. Details Pages show the List of Items This is usually cause by not setting the URL Parameter in the App Metadata. Easy to fix. Page Headers are not Set on Cached Requests If you have older apps, especially the old blog which may set page headers using the RazorBlade HtmlPage object, you may get unexpected results. The reason is that this sets headers directly when the code is executed. So once the data is cached, the code doesn't run any more. Solution Change your code to use the IPageService instead. It will queue the page changes and this queue will also be processed in cached situations. History Created in 2sxc 13.10 Shortlink: https://go.2sxc.org/lightspeed"

It will use LookUp sources to resolve the values. The LookUp System is in the ToSic.Eav.LookUp namespace The LookUp Engine is an ILookUpEngine Warning This is very technical stuff, you usually don't need to know this. We're just including it for completeness sake. LookUpEngine LookUp Engines will collect a set of LookUp objects and use these to resolve strings like Module:ModuleId. For this, they will check which LookUp has the right name (in this case Module) and will ask it if it can provide the value (in this case the ModuleId). Notes Usually LookUp Engines will receive a long list (Dictionary) of things to look up, and resolve these in one quick call. This is because often they are attached to a DataSource which requires many configuration values - so they will prepare the list of parameters, pass it to the LookUpEngine and then work with the results as needed. Tip LookUp Engines can also perform default-fallbacks - so if a LookUp source can't provide the answer needed, the engine may use a static value instead: [QueryString:PageSize||10] Tip LookUp Engines can also perform lookup-fallbacks if the source can't provide an answer. In this case it may ask another LookUp if it has the answer. This happens when the Token looks like this: [QueryString:PageSize||[App:Settings:PageSize]] C# and Dependency Injection LookUp Engines all implement the ILookUpEngine interface and should inherit the LookUpEngine object. LookUpEngine objects are provided with DepedencyInjection. The system that gets the currently valid LookUpEngine inherits the ILookUpEngineResolver.

Examples could be: The current Page ID to then find metadata for this page The current Date to filter out news items which should be published in future An Id from the URL Parameters to show details about this id This is done using Tokens which look like [QueryString:Id]. To achieve this 2sxc has three parts: Tokens which parses the placeholders The LookUpEngine which will get the values... ...using LookUp Sources to really resolve the values. Tip The LookUp System is used in Queries and Token Templates. But since Token-Templates are fairly trivial, we recommand that you only use Tokens for Queries and instead create your Templates using Razor. Example Without LookUp Imagine a Query which has an EntityId Filter which expects an ID. This could be hardwired like this: What happens now is as follows: The EntityId-Filter will pass all the settings to be parsed by the LookUp-Engine The LookUp-Engine will detect that it's a simple value (not a Token) and just return the 38654 The EntityId-Filter will then do it's job and retrieve this item Example With LookUp But it would make more sense if the ID were to be dynamic, maybe from the URL like this: What happens now is as follows: The EntityId-Filter will pass all the settings to be parsed by the LookUp-Engine The LookUp-Engine will detect the Token and parse it Since the first part in the token says QueryString the LookUp-Engine will check if it has a LookUp-Source by that name Since it has a LookUp which answers to QueryString, it will ask this source if it can resolve id Assuming that the page has ?id=38654 then the LookUp will say yes! it's 38654 The EntityId-Filter will then do it's job and retrieve this item Discover More The Token Syntax and all the features LookUp Engine LookUp Sources Query LookUps Token Template LookUps For example, when a Query is created, it may need to know the current PortalId or the current time, to properly filter/sort something.

The Settings source only exists in your C# code, not in the VisualQuery. Settings What is a LookUp Source (technical ⚠) LookUp Sources are ILookUp objects and have a Name like like QueryString, Module, Portal etc. Each one is capable of retrieving values like Id or DefaultPage. So the Engine will ask the specific source for the expected value and the source will try to find it. If it has an answer, it will return that. If it doesn't find anything it will return null and let the Engine take care of fallback options. Tip Everything is lazy, so these objects are only accessed and populated if the parameter is actually needed. This results in great performance. All LookUp objects implement the ILookUp interface and inherit the LookUpBase object. Internal LookUp Objects (technical ⚠) Just to give you an idea of the power of LookUp objects, here are some in use: LookUpInEntity - this resolves entity values. LookUpInNameValueCollection - this resolves from name/value lists like Dictionary or Request.QueryString objects LookUpInLookUps - will look up values in various attached LookUp objects LookUpInDataTarget - will look up a value from an In stream of a DataSource LookUpInDnnPropertyAccess - will look up stuff in Dnn specific PropertyAccess objects, which are similar to LookUp objects LookUpInEntity - will look up things in an IEntity and also provide more information like Count, IsFirst, etc. for the Token Engine Also Read LookUp System History General Tokens introduced in 2sxc 1.0 Most enhancements were in 2sxc 07.00"

    "keywords": "[](xref:Abyss.Parts.LookUp.Index) LookUp Tokens Explained you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .query-params, .context-box-summary .lookup { visibility: visible; } Often you need a placeholder which should be resolved at runtime with a real value from elsewhere. In Dnn / 2sxc this is called a Token, and they usually look like [Source:Property]. Simple Example As example could be [DateTime:Now] which would be resolved to the current date/time at runtime. You would use this in a Query to filter out news which should be published in future, so PublicationDate < [DateTime:Now]. Note There is also a TokenEngine which uses the same Token mechanism to generate HTML. What you see here also applies to that, but it's actually a separate topic. Some Token Examples [Portal:PortalId] would return the current portal Id [App:Settings:PageSize] would return the page size as configured in app-settings [QueryString:Id] would retrieve the id-parameter from the url [MyConfiguration:ProductId] would retrieve the id as configured in the UI by the user [MyConfiguration:productId||27] would also try to get the id, but return 27 if not found Token Basics A token is a piece of text that looks like [Source:Property], which will be replaced by an engine so that it will then be a value. For example, [QueryString:Page] is replaced with 2 if the current url has ?page=2 in it. You can research more about tokens in older docs here and in the full list of standard tokens, it's a standard Dnn concept. Internally it uses a LookUp-Engine which itself uses LookUp-Sources - see [](Abyss.Parts.LookUp.Index. Special Token Features in 2sxc/EAV The EAV and 2sxc have enhanced Tokens to a new level with these features: 1. Sub-Tokens A token like [App:Settings:PageSize] will go through a tree of info-objects to find an inner property if it exists. This only works on special object types that are specifically meant to provide sub-data. 2. Fallback A token like [QueryString:page||1] will deliver the url-param, and if that is empty, will deliver 1. Note that you need 2 pipe symbols | because the convention is that after the first pipe you can have a format specifier like #.##. 3. Stacking Stacking with more Tokens: a token like [QueryString:PageSize||[App:Settings:PageSize]] will try the first token, and if it doesn't resolve, try the next one 4. Recursion A token can resolve into a token, which would then be looked up again. So if a token [MyConfiguration:Page||1] is used, and the setting Page is not a number but again a token like [QueryString:Page], then it will... resolve Settings:Page and find Querystring:Page resolve QueryString:Page and maybe find something if that is empty, return the fallback 1 Advanced Token Sources in Special Scenarios Some situations will have token sources beyond the default. For example, when configuring data sources they always have 2 more sources In - used like [In:Default:PageSize] MyConfiguration - used like [MyConfiguration:PageSize] There is another special override-token system which is used for testing Also Read LookUp System IDataStream Guide DataSources - Big Picture DataSource Configuration: Configuration.Parse() History General Tokens introduced in 2sxc 1.0 Most enhancements were in 2sxc 07.00"

Not yet Implemented features in Oqtane CustomizeData / CustomizeSearch are not implemented yet, we're not yet sure how we want to implement this WebAPIs We should probably create a list of viable base classes and explain the differences REST APIs No relevant differences, except that the root paths to the APIs are different. This is automatically handled if you use 2sxc, and for external code you can get the exact endpoints in the admin UI. JavaScript Differences No relevant differences, except that Oqtane doesn't include jQuery by default. If you need jQuery, activate it using the IPageService. CSS-Frameworks / HTML Differences No relevant differences. Note that Oqtane by default uses Bootstrap5 so the output may look a bit different. Image Resizing In Oqtane, only ADAM files and App-files can use the ImageResizer. Files from the normal file management cannot use it.

In general when updating from v9 to v14 there are no expected problems. Before going to v14 you must be running DNN 9.6.1 or newer. In very rare cases you may be affected by breaking changes Features currently not implemented None, all 2sxc features are available in DNN.

Dnn Evoq History and Liquid Content Evoq originally started as a clone of Dnn in 2012. At that time it didn't have any real Dynamic Data / Dynamic Content features. 2sxc just worked on that version, but at that time was just getting started. To compete with other paid enterprise CMS solutions such as SiteCore, Evoq tried to re-invent the wheel in 2017 and created a system called Liquid Content which was meant to provide similar functionality as 2sxc. Evoq wasn't able to include 2sxc, because that would have made it identical to the free version, so they were forced to brew their own. The Liquid Content is very data-focused (records of data + visualizers) so it doesn't feel like Web Content Management at all. It's more like a data-management + show-the-data-here kind of functionality. It appears that after that, Evoq lost interest in this subject, because Liquid Content never got past v1.0. According to users it misses a lot of very basic features such as multi-language, proper versioning and data-relationships. It also doesn't work with Page-Workflow (2sxc does) and the templating language is so restrictive, that solutions built using Liquid Content are forced to choose inappropriate data structures just to get it to work. Many Evoq customers then switched to 2sxc because they felt that Liquid Content didn't deliver on its promises. Migrate from Liquid Content to 2sxc We've tried various attempts to assist in migrations, but it doesn't make sense in any way. The reason is that any work done in Liquid Content was restricted by missing features in the data models as well as missing features in the home-brew templating language which is is based on Liquid.net. This means that any solution built using Liquid Content isn't made the way such a solution would be built, and any automatic porting would result in a very strange data model which would make life really difficult. So you best process is to simply start over. Sorry 🤷🏾. Evoq and 2sxc Version Compatibilities Evoq V.

XMas Breaking Changes in 2sxc 15.00 Tip In summary we've made a lot of internal breaking changes. But for all normal users it will have no effect at all. We believe it will only affect you in these scenarios: If you have a custom DataSource, you will need to make some minor changes and recompile them If you used special, non-public Logging APIs you would need to update your work If you used any undocumented APIs, you will need to check if everything still works API Changes that may affect you DataSource base class was completely refactored see instructions Old static ToSic.Eav.DataSource was removed (deprecated since v13) Internal logging API ILog was completely refactored see instructions Internal object wrappers were completely refactored see instructions TinyMCE Upgrade to v6 Database changes Minor API changes Breaking Updates which probably don't affect anybody SQL changes - minor updates to the Database Internal APIs which were removed Static ToSic.Eav.Data.Builder.AttribBuilder.AddValue(...)

But for all normal users it will have no effect at all. We believe it will only affect you in these scenarios: TODO API Changes that may affect you An internal user property IUser.IsDesigner was renamed to IUser.IsSiteDeveloper An internal, deprecated user property IUser.IsAdmin was removed An internal, deprecated user property IUser.IsSuperUser was removed An internal property IUser.Guid was changed from Guid? to Guid The Users DataSource had a property called IncludeSystemAdmins which was changed from bool to string to allow for more options The Users DataSource had a property called RoleIds which returned a non-standard string-array. It has been removed, and the new Roles returns standard related entities. Removed static ToSic.Eav.Data.Build.Entity(...) method which was deprecated in v12 API Changes which should really not affect you These are internal APIs which we changed to make everything more immutable. They should never have been in use outside of the internal code. Changed IValue.Languages from IList to IEnumerable and made it immutable Change IEntity.Attributes from Dictionary<string, IAttribute> to IImmutableDictionary<string, IAttribute> as a step to later make it immutable Removed some old, probably never used APIs on IAttribute<T> such as IAttribute<T>[int[] languageIDs] IAttribute<T>[string] IAttribute<T>[string[]] IAttribute[string[] languageKeys] - was always marked as private Changed the type of Attribute.Type from string to ValueTypes to make it more strongly typed Removed the property Attribute.ControlledType which previously contained the ValueType Changes in 2sxc 15.04 (2023-03-22) ✅ Oqtane: Compatibility with Oqtane 15.04 ✅ Formula improvements ✅ Get App or global settings for formulas ✅ Better support for promises ✅ Ability to set the value of another field ✅ Intellisense on Formulas ✅ Cdn remapping to other cdn like cdn.2sxc.org or custom CDN ✅ Ability to remap all cdn urls to a different url ✅ New template CDN on https://cdn.2sxc.org ✅ New template repo for anybody that wants to create their own CDN or host on their path https://github.com/2sxc/cdn.2sxc.org New APIs for Data Sources finalized ✅ Public IDataFactory API ✅ Public IDataSourceFactory API ✅ Enhanced IDataSource API ✅ Prototype of live DataSources ✅ Make everything internal immutable ✅ Improve WYSIWYG ✅ Ability to select which \"mode\" the editor is in, affecting toolbars ✅ Allow selected mode to affect other things (like deny image-drop if in text-mode) ✅ Sections to better align images ✅ Use classes to determine size instead of styles ✅ WYSIWYG Images which auto-resize on the server based on size (eg 1/2 of the screen) ✅ New Data Sources and System Queries ✅ New Data Source Scopes ✅ New Query Scopes ✅ New Data Source MetadataTargetTypes ✅ New Query MetadataTargetTypes ✅ New DataSource Licenses - with state ✅ New Query Licenses ✅ New DataSource Features - with state ✅ New Query Features ✅ New DataSource Sites ✅ New Query Sites ✅ Improve data sources for Pages ✅ Query Improvements ✅ Allow edit/new to be done in a query-selector ✅ Get query to know if entity can be edited (based on AppId) ✅ We've renamed the system queries to have a much simpler name such as System.Sites which we'll make available to public use soon. ✅ New LookUp for Settings- and Resources-Stack - to use Settings and Resources ✅ Change internal key for Settings to MyConfiguration to avoid naming conflicts (breaking but probably no impact) ✅ Custom DataSources - breaking ✅ New IDataFactory API ✅ New RawEntity and IRawEntity API ✅ New API for data sources to make data generation easier ✅ Improved custom DataSources API ✅ New base class CustomDataSourceLight ✅ New base class CustomDataSourceAdvanced ✅ Error handling is now simpler / more standardized ✅ Jewels ✅ CmsContext.View now has a Path, PathShared, PhysicalPath and PhysicalPathShared property ✅ Page.Activate(...) now has a condition: true parameter which lets you only activate a feature if a condition is met ✅ Page.Parameters has new Get(name) and Get<type>(name) and Get(name, fallback: 7) APIs to make it easier to work with url parameters ✅ The Toolbar now has a new Info button which is used to show an info-bubble to the user or provide a help-link to somewhere. You'll soon see this in our standard apps to inform users about special cases such as \"why the toolbar isn't available on demo-data\" ✅ Bugs fixes ✅ 2sxc in DNN Skins on 404 pages https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/2986 ✅ Issue with Mobius Forms in v15.03 Breaking Changes in 2sxc 15.06 Tip In summary we've made a lot of internal breaking changes. But for all normal users it will have no effect at all. We believe it will only affect you in these scenarios: TODO API Changes that may affect you on IEntity These were internal APIs which were not publicly documented, but may have been used by some developers. IEntity.GetDraft() was removed to ensure the entity is immutable IEntity.GetPublished() was removed to ensure the entity is immutable Note: GetDraft() and GetPublished() are still available on DynamicEntity in Razor and WebApi. They were only removed on IEntity. Renamed DataSources These data sources had uncommon names, and were renamed to be more consistent. We believe that they were only used in VisualQuery and not in code, so it should not affect you. CsvDataSource is now Csv SerializationConfiguration is now Serialization Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v14 We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary V14 did some clean-up of internal APIs, but otherwise there are no known breaking changes. Note that these changes could be seen as a breaking change for certain users: Change in App Zip Package in v14.08 v14.08 Change in App Data Folder in v14.08 v14.08 All Changes V14 14.00 - 14.07.05 (2022-Q2 & 2022-Q3) Q2 ✅ Image-Service/Picture ✅ Image primary area / corner selector ✅ Patron features with licensing & payment system ✅ LightSpeed cache ✅ v14 Release ✅ DNN 9.6.1 only ✅ Formula Boost with many new features #1 ✅ DNN DI integration ✅ Update turnOn to 0.1.2 ✅ CSP for the site (DNN only ATM) ✅ Formula Boost #2 (more context info, features-infos, etc.) ✅ NPM Types updated to latest release ✅ Enterprise Features which will be availabe for bigger sponsors ✅ Patron-System, where sponsors of 2sxc get some extra features ✅ Standardize how to integrate into other systems (non-Dnn/Oqtane) ✅ Service Kits ✅ Deprecation System ✅ Toolbar Services v1 ✅ JS Docs updated to the latest version and auto-generated ✅ Tutorials Formulas ✅ Update all Apps to the lastest/greatest conventions ✅ v14 LTS Q3 ✅ Toolbars Service Improvements ✅ icon-metadata ✅ group C# API - ToolbarBuilder now has Group command ✅ SVG icons - Toolbar Buttons can now use SVGs for icons (usually base64 encoded) ✅ base64 ✅ ui multiple params ✅ bugfixes ✅ params multiple params ✅ array params ✅ Debug-logging on Oqtane client side code, bugfixing ca. 0.5d ✅ Change storage of app.xml to App_Data, change how import works and enable import-from-folder/git ✅ Clean up JS code, latest webpack, packages etc. ca. 1d ✅ Infrastructure for automated testing of JS - ca. 5d Apps / App Maintenance ✅ Update most apps which used ephemeral variables for formulas to just use parameters (new in v14) ca. 0.5d ✅ new Timeline Apps ✅ new Files App ✅ new Jobs ✅ Make many Apps backwards compatible with Bootstrap 3 for a big customer ✅ Have the core apps tested & optimized for WCAG for a government customer ✅ Re-release sxc-angular ✅ Remove dependency on SharpZipLib 14.09 - 14.12 (2022-10) ✅ Improve UI/Flow of system registration (ATM still confusing) ✅ Make sure edit-ui doesn't need material fonts from CDN for icons ✅ Create a new app.json configuration file for 2sxc apps to tune how export/import works ✅ Remove Newtonsoft JSON and migrate to System.Text.Json ✅ Improve handling of app-metadata (resources, settings) ✅ Enable init and import completely new app directly from folder/git copy 1d SDV ✅ Ability to sync Apps through git including the Assets and ADAM ✅ Improve handing feature details to edit-ui Data Sources New data source Users New data source Roles ✅ Update Imageflow to latest version ✅ Remove dependency on Newtonsoft - only use System.Text.Json ✅ Create https://schemas.2sxc.org for json schemas ✅ Create JSON Schemas for image recipe and app.json ✅ More formula tutorials how to call a WebAPI ✅ Security update System.Data.SqlClient ✅ Oqtane 2shine Theme release ✅ cre8magic v0.0.1 released 14.12.00 - 14.12.03 LTS (November 2022) ✅ Publish blazor-cms.org ✅ get a great page speed - 95%+ ✅ Get blazor-cms.org to index really well in google ✅ v14 LTS #2 ca. v14.12 🚀 Important Changes Assembly Binding Issue on Installs from 2sxc 13.04 to 14.02 Change in App Zip Package in v14.08 v14.08 Change in App Data Folder in v14.08 v14.08 New app.json with Export Exclude v14.09 Version 13 TODO New WebApi route app/auto/data to replace /app/auto/content - the old one will still work, but we won't document it any more, because it was a confusing name Lots of metadata stuff... TODO: New sxc.data and sxc.query Breaking Changes in 2sxc 13.00 API Changes that may affect you An old, non-DI feature for Inner Content is being deprecated and will be removed in v14 see instructions An old feature for publishing module InstanceData as JSON is removed see instructions An old feature to create DataSources is removed see instructions Two old data-conversion features DataToDictionary and EntitiesToDictionary were removed see instructions Some internal functionality which enabled IEntity objects to convert links containing file:... and page:... has been removed. This only affects special deep code calls on IEntity and does _not affect DynamicEntity objects in Razor see instructions The old feature Eav.Factory.Resolve<T>() was deprecated and will be removed in v14 see instructions The old feature BlockDataSource.Cache.GetContentType(...) was removed see instructions The Dnn Static ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Factory is being deprecated and will be removed in v14 see instructions Major Updates with may affect you The Image Resizer is being replaced with ImageFlow The App containing Site-wide settings is changed to Primary - previously it used the Content app for this. We believe this won't affect many users, as the settings-stack is still very new in v12 Things which probably don't affect anybody SQL changes - minor updates to the Database .net Framework and Dll Updated to Match Dnn 9 Requirements - but still works in Dnn 7.4.2 .net Framework 4.7.2 now required (previously .net Framework 4.5.1) .net Standard 2.0.3 required (previously .net Standard 1.6) Important: This will be referenced in the web.config upon installation Dependency Injection updated to .net core 2.1.1 (previously 1.1) Newtonsoft.Json updated to v10.0.3 Entity Framework updated to 2.1.1 (previously 1.1) - Oqtane is unmodified and uses 3.1.4 Dnn DLLs renamed ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.dll became ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Core.dll for consistency ToSic.SexyContent.WebApi.dll became ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.WebApi.dll ToSic.SexyContent.Razor.dll became ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Razor.dll An internal object ToSic.Eav.Apps.State was removed Internal APIs which were removed Static ToSic.Eav.Data.Builder.AttribBuilder.AddValue(...) 13.01 JSON fields Link.Image with srcSet Parameter ?

This shouldn't affect your code, since all old code usually runs in DNN where jQuery is included by default. Changes Version 12.06 LTS No relevant changes Changes Version 12.05 Introduced IJsonService for json serialize/deserialize Introduced IConvertService for simple data-type conversion, also available on the Convert property of Razor12 and Api12 Introduced ToSic.Sxc.Services.ILogService to log messages to the system (Dnn/Oqtane) Introduced IMailService to easily send mails cross-platform Introduced ISecureDataService to use encrypted settings Introduced IRenderService for inner-content rendering (Oqtane code must use this) Published ToSic.Eav.DataFormats.EavLight to better document simple eav data Published IConvertToEavLight as the new standard way to prepare entities for WebAPI serialization. This is meant to replace previous code using objects such as EntitiesToDictionary or DataToDictionary which are now marked as obsolete. New Razor12, Api12 and Code12 Classes now don't support old, obsolete APIs anymore Link.Image now also accepts parameters as a parameter Link.Image and Link.To always create safe urls now (spaces are encoded etc.) Link.To and Link.Image now have a parameter type which can be \"full\" to ensure domains are always added to links (for use in APIs generating RSS etc.) Update to RazorBlade v3.7 Edit.Toolbar now supports condition so that toolbars may or may not be created based on a true/false value Link.Image now also accepts a factor or aspectRatio which is a string like 1:2 or 3/4 AsDynamic(...) now also wraps anonymous objects in quite an amazing way Bugfix: lots of small ones Breaking Change Version 12.05 V12 adds new properties to Razor and WebAPI which could result in some surprises: Path, Convert, Settings, Resources and DevTools. Especially the new Path and Convert could clash with existing code which had @using System or @using System.IO so the code would just read Path.GetFileName(...) or something. Because of this, we only give the latest classes Custom.Dnn.Razor12, Custom.Dnn.Code12, Custom.Hybrid.Razor12, Custom.Hybrid.Api12 etc. these properties. This means that previous base classes do not have these by design, and we encourage you to move to these latest base classes. Important: 2sxc 12.00 - 12.04 also had some of these properties on ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent as well as ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController. So if you were eager to use these properties but didn't change the base class, you were able to use it. To protect thousands of upgrade-scenarios we had to take them away from the old base classes. Sorry! Possible Breaking Changes We believe nothing broke, but it could be that some commands on EntitiesToDictionary or DataToDictionary were accidentally changed. Pls report so we can fix that. The Link.To(...) now returns safe URLs. This should not be an issue, but in rare cases post-processing of the string returned may expect spaces or something, which are now %20 We disabled old obsolete APIs on the new Razor12, Api12 and Code12 base classes. In case you were using this (not likely) you'll get an error telling you about this. Changes Version 12.04 incl 12.03 which was not officially released Settings Stack and Resources Stack added, and the Settings / Resources object now have this Global Settings.Images.xxx settings defined for Content, Screen, Lightbox and Section Global Settings.Resources.xxx defined for fancybox3, fancybox4, bootstrap4, bootstrap5 Link.Image API created to support predefined sizes/resize modes etc. Created feature where DynamicEntities can browse to sub-items using their identifier (used for Settings.Images.Content where Content is actually the title of a sub-entity) Added debug-feature for DynamicEntity get String-Dropdown inputs now have a value-key presets option (instead of the key-value which was flaky) and added support for escaping special characters #Oqtane 2.2 support added Introduced Monaco (VS-Code online) editor for beta-testing source-editing Breaking Change Version 12.04 DynamicEntity now has a property Count because it's a list as well, this could cause issues if a content-type has a property Count DynamicEntity is now always a list. Because of this we removed the DynamicEntityWithList object. We believe the type is never referenced in user code, but if it is, this would be a breaking change. Many parts that prepare Entities returned a Dictionary<string, object> and now return an IDictionary<string, object>. We believe this shouldn't hurt much, since the result would usually be in a var or returend directly to the API for streaming, but in case someone had used explicitly typed code, this will require a minor change Changes Version 12.02 Formulas feature finalized DynamicEntityStack object created Hybrid IPageService created with Activate and similar features CmsContext was enhanced with View information Content-Type icons can now be stored in the app with an [App:Path]/image.jpg style reference Enabled view-configuration to configure search behavior incl. not-to-index or what streams should be indexed turnOn created / deployed #Oqtane 2.1 support added in 2sxc 12.02.01 Changes Version 12.00 Todo Version 11 Changes Version 11.00 Breaking Changes The following changes are all super-low-profile, but we want to document them just to be through: DataStream and IDataStream loses a very old property called .LightList - we're pretty sure it's not in use anywhere, if you have it, just use .List instead. Enhancements Brand new Admin UI based on Angular 9 and Ivy with new Code-Editor, new VisualQuery and much more Razor CodeBehind Automatic Polymorphism Updated Razor Blades to 3.02 with the new Tags.SafeUrl(...) command Field: Boolean-Tristate which saves true/false/null App.Data.Create(...) now returns entities it just created Changes Version 11.01 Enhancements In-Page Toolbar now recognises sub-item lists and provides sorting and editing buttons #2009 Item-lists now have a button to add existing items to them #1278 New system to create extensions in an app, in the system folder Ability to create custom Input Fields just by placing them in the system folder #2070 Minor Improve Equality Check for DynamicEntities and EntitiesInList #2075 Data-table in admin UI now shows Title field no matter if there is another field which is the title #1639 Button to flush app-cache in admin-ui #2073 2sxc Insights now available from the super-user toolbar #2069 PT translations are added again #2064 Loads of enhancements and minor issues in the UI Changes Version 11.02 Enhancements App-Extensions system in the folder system Custom WebComponent based input fields #2082 API to reconfigure the wysiwyg input control #2090 Show view use with links to pages and more #2077 UI - fields can now be set to not-translate #2086 UI - boolean can now show different labels based on the value it has #2085 Minor Add HR language pack for editor #2087 show app-name in admin ui show app-icon in apps-management #2078 Changes Version 11.03 - todo Changes Version 11.04 - todo Changes Version 11.05 Old Edit UI be removed Old Admin-UI be removed APIs which only the old UIs used be removed Old helper JS for AngularJS apps (located in /js/angularjs) will be removed from the distribution. They had not been updated for over 3 years and we believe they were not widely used. Anybody upgrading will still preserve the files that are there. If you really need them, download an old release of 2sxc and get them manually. Changes Version 11.06 - 11.11 - todo 👉 See the Project Issues Changes Version 11.13 VisualQuery 3 with a lot of new features Click on a stream shows what's in that stream Much better error handling to avoid queries from crashing if a stream has an error All internal DataSources were updated to use this new Error-Handling Output of Query is now tabbed which is much nicer to use Visual-Query only returns top 25 results by default to help with creating queries with large amounts of data UI was enhanced to show more user-friendly names/infos DynamicIn was introduced so DataSources can indicate that they expect a lot of In-streams UI enhanced with better/larger buttons/icons In Streams are now managed better so they can connect before it's known if the source Out actually has that stream New DataSource Error to provoke an error in a Query for testing New DataSource SerializationConfiguration lets you determine how things are serialized DataSource AttributeFilter enhanced to have keep-all or remove-all and multi-line configuration (easier) New DataSource Tutorial with updated sample code Insights-Logging was enhanced to log Exceptions (used in the VisualQuery Error handling) Bugfixes Toolbar had issue when color code was numbers only Changes Version 11.14 - 11.22 LTS TODO Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v11 We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary There were small breaking changes in 11.00 to 11.11 but they were internal so shouldn't affect normal developers. Breaking Changes Version 11.07 - Drop the old edit UI In 11.07 the old edit UI was removed, so customizations for that UI would not be in effect any more. Breaking Changes Version 11.10 - Mainly Dependency Injection In v11.10 we used much more dependency injection than ever before and stopped using static values which were still in the API in many places. Because of this, certain helper objects to create entities or lookup values were changed and their constructors were changed. We invested a lot of time to try to ensure that old APIs still work, but in case you're hit by one of these, make sure you check the DI and switch to resolving the objects using DI. Breaking Changes Version 11.11 - Language Detection Previously the language detection used the Thread culture. Turns out this wasn't reliable because Dnn does some funny stuff (probably historical) which means that API-calls ended up using the language stored in some cookie instead of the one specified by the URL. We changed this, which should be more reliable. But if you were relying on this strange effect, then it may be a breaking change. Internally our tokens were also using the thread culture. When we changed this, we also had to change how tokens pick up the language. In rare cases this may affect you. We changed all tokens to always resolve boolean values to true/false (previously they would have been changed to the current language, like wahr for german). We believe this change is only an improvement, and should ensure that internal resolves in Queries etc. result in reliable output. Breaking Changes Version 11.11 - DataSources: DataSourceConfiguration Note that we also improved the DataSourceConfiguration to an interface IDataSourceConfiguration and documented this. As a side effect the API stays the same, but you will have to recompile your data sources for them to work again - sorry. Breaking Changes Version 11.11.03 - IEntity Values IEntity had a command called Value(fieldName) which was probably never used. The idea used to be that it does language lookup internally, but we refactored this out since it could never be fully reliable because the full language list wasn't known to the IEntity. So we re-purposed the method (assuming it's not used) to just lookup the first occurance of the value. This way it`s useful for configurations and similar which are not multi-language. IEntity also had a Value(fieldname, lookup) method. We are deprecating it, and making the lookup not happen from now on. We believe it was never used. IEntity had a command called PrimaryValue(fieldName) which was probably never ever used, so we're deprecating it. Use Value(fieldName) instead. Breaking Changes Version 11.11.03 - Other UI Toolbar dropped the button and command for item-history, as the history is now part of the edit dialog Version 10 Changes Version 10.01 - 10.09 LTS Develop and fine-tuning of the new Edit-UI based on Angular 8 Changes Version 10.20-00 to 10.20-05 Enhanced ListCache so it will prevent parallel buildup - important for long-loading DataSources like SharePoint DataSources Updating to RazorBlade 3.1 which doesn't need extension methods Changes Version 10.20-06 Created AsDynamic(string) Created AsDynamic(DataSource) to enable AsDynamic(Data) instead of AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]) Changes Version 10.21 New AsList() for better code New AsDynamic(string) to work with json /dist/ is now cleaned up on every update, to better distribute changing JS file structures Changes Version 10.22 Query Params added for VisualQuery Created QueryRun DataSource Insights now includes the code file and line numbers Insights now also measures time needed to execute some code Various performance enhancements Improved SoC for AppsCache and AppRoot DataSource Changes Version 10.23 Lots of logging enhancements Changes Version 10.24 LTS New stable LTS Improved/fixed QueryRun DataSource Improved Insights Enhancements to use 2sxc with Redis Cache WYSIWYG enhancements for better H1-Hx, P and Blockquote Performance enhancements Intenal refactoring for APIs Introduced an internal Compatibility-Level to disable very old features when using new RazorComponents Changes Version 10.25 LTS Changed how the $2sxc client JavaScripts are loaded for much better performance and better Google PageSpeed Enabled various features for the Content area which previously were hidden, like Resources and Settings Released brand new Content-Templates App with best-practices for 10.25 Fixed bugs with Evoq Page Publishing Enhanced the ValueFilter DataSource to handle dates which were null Changes Version 10.26 TinyMCE Updated to 5.1 Enhanced CreateInstance API to also work when compiling Razor files from a WebApi New DataSource StreamPick New automatic Param called [Params:ShowDrafts] to be used in VisualQuery - returns True or False New tokens [App:AppId] and [App:ZoneId] to use in VisualQuery calles (dropdown from query) Changed List-Caching bbehavior to create more reliable cache-keys for complex queries (previously it only went through Default streams to generate the cache-key) Changes Version 10.27 Possibly breaking changes Because the dynamic entity list now has a type which is dynamic, it cannot be cast to List<dynamic> any more. IList<dynamic> works, but in case you have any code casting it to List<dynamic> you'll need to change that to either IList<dynamic> or IEnumerable<dynamic>. New Features / Major Improvements Changed DynamicEntity so that accessing a property which contains many other entities it will return a DynamicEntityWithList. This allows Razor files to access the properties like .EntityId or .FirstName of the main entity in a sub-list easily without requiring AsList(...) #1993 Updated Quick-Dialog to use Angular 9, Ivy and the latest Dnn-Sxc-Angular #1992 New DataSource AttributeRename #2004 Completely refactored internal list management API #1995 Complete refactoring of the inpage code to make it typesafe (no more any types) Created brand-new, simpler way to create custom Toolbars and specs Introduces JS/API 2sxc-Insights for debugging In-Page code Enhancements Performance-Enhance App DataSource to delay building objects until needed #1991 Performance-Enhance internal Token Lookup #1998 Enhanced Dnn Search Index logging #1997 Corrected help-links on all data sources #1994 Bugfixes Cache-All-Streams only used the Default-Streams for Cache-Key identification #1988 QueryRun DataSource doesn't show statitics on all streams #1989 Modified date and Owner information were missing on json stored entities #2005 / #2006 Fixed bug in JS API for non-2sxc endpoint resolution #2000 Queries didn't resolve Dnn tokens when accessed in the Search Index #1999 Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary Version 10 has a lot of small breaking changes because we restructured the internal API so it's consistent when we publish it. All these things shouldn't affect you, because they were internal APIs, but in case it does - here's what we did. Version 10.22 and 10.23 Renamed the RootDataSource and the Interface to IAppRoot Split SOC of the AppRoot DataSource so that caching, Root-Metadata and ListCache is fully separate Since the Logging system now auto-picks up the code lines and names of the methods, we simplified the commands and dropped some parameters. Moved quite a bit of the DataSource objects into sub-objects, again for SOC. Version 10.20-04 (ca. 2019-12-03) Renamed DataTableDataSource to DataTable, old name still works. Renamed ExternalDataDataSource to ExternalData, old name still works. Renamed ToSic.SexyContent.DataSources.ModuleDataSource to ToSic.Sxc.DataSources.CmsBlock, old name still works. Renamed ToSic.Eav.DataSources.VisualQuery.VisualQueryAttribute to ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Queries.VisualQueryAttribute, old name still works. Renamed ToSic.SexyContent.Environment.Dnn7.Factory to ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Factory, old name still works. Renamed ToSic.Eav.DataSources.BaseDataSource to ToSic.Eav.DataSources.DataSourceBase for consistency, old name still works. Moved the LookUp namespaces into the Core DLL Version 10.20-02 (ca. 2019-11-22) More internal changes which shouldn't affect anybody, but make the API ready for public docs... Moved/renamed the internal Eav.AppDataPackage to Eav.Apps.AppState Moved/renamed some internal interfaces like Entity... Did a major change for how Attribute<T> for relationships work. Before they were Attribute<EntityRelationship> and now they are Attribute<IEnumerable<IEntity>>. This also affects Value<EntityRelationship> which is now Value<IEnumerable<IEntity>> Moved Tenant<T> and Container<T> including matching interfaces to Eav.Environment Renamed IAppIdentity to IInAppAndZone and IZoneIdentity to IInZone Renamed ICacheKeyProvider to ICacheKey Renamed CacheChainedIEnumerable<T> to SynchronizedList<T> Moved/Renamed MetadataFor to Eav.Metadata.Target. Left old name compatible. Moved some extension methods for IEntity from ToSic.Eav.Data.Query to ToSic.Eav.Data Changed Permissions to be strongly typed EntityBased objects Version 10.20.01 (2019-11-12) Internal code now uses the term Header instead of ListContent. External code provides both for backward-compatibility moved internal interfaces for engines (Razor/Token) to final namespaces ToSic.Sxc.Engines IEngine EngineBase ITokenEngine IRazorEngine corrected architecture - some template-management code had slipped into Eav.Apps, was moved back to Sxc.Apps The Template object was moved from Eav.Apps to Sxc.Views and we added an interface IView. We also renamed the internal properti ViewNameInUrl to UrlIdentifier. To correct the API a CmsManager was created extending the AppManager, which is in charge of Views Moving internal stuff related to content blocks IContentBlock from SexyContent.Interfaces to Sxc.Blocks from ToSic.SexyContent.ISxcInstance to ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.IBlockContext actually moved a lot of things there incl. ContentBlock now BlockConfiguration and more - all internal stuff Moving the ToSic.SexyContent.App to ToSic.Sxc.Apps.App In a razor page, we added the preferred Purpose. The old InstancePurpose will still work Placed some things we just moved in 10.20 to a final place - since it's a very recent change, we updated the docs in the 10.20.00 section Changed, but completely internal Some namespaces on SexyContent.ContentBlocks were moved to Sxc.Blocks Version 10.20.00 (2019-11-05) the internal interface IInPageEditingHelpers was moved from ToSic.SexyContent.Interfaces to the namespace ToSic.Sxc.Web the internal interface ILinkHelper was moved to ToSic.Sxc.Web the internal interface IHtmlHelper was moved to ToSic.Sxc.Dnn the property Configuration on dynamic entities was deprecated in 2sxc 4 and removed in 2sxc 10 - we don't think it was ever used moved internal Metadata interfaces (ca. 5) into final namespace ToSic.Eav.Metadata Moved a bunch of internal interfaces which we believe were never used externally from ToSic.Eav.Interfaces to ToSic.Eav.Data ToSic.Eav.Data.IAttribute ToSic.Eav.IAttribute<T> IAttributeBase IAttributeDefinition IChildEntities IContentType IDimension IEntityLight ILanguage IRelationshipManager IValue IValue<T> IValueOfDimension<T> Moved a bunch of internal interfaces which we believe were never used externally from ToSic.Eav.Apps.Interfaces to ToSic.Eav.Apps IApp IAppData IAppDataConfiguration IAppEnvironment IEnvironmentFactory IInstanceInfo IItemListAction IPagePublishing ITenant IZoneMapper the internal namespace ToSic.Eav.ValueProvider was changed to ToSic.Eav.LookUp and inside it we renamed a bunch of internal interfaces and objects which we believe were never used externally Deprecated/Changed, but not broken the internal interface ToSic.SexyContent.IAppAndDataHelpers was renamed to ToSic.Sxc.IDynamicCode but the old interface still exists, so it shouldn't break it was used by Mobius Forms moved ToSic.Eav.Interfaces.IEntity to ToSic.Eav.Data.IEntity - but preserved the old interface for compatibility it was used everywhere Clean-Up, but not broken We're transitioning to the term Header instead of ListContent in templates. The Razor pages and WebApi have this starting now, while old terms still work.

We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary V16.00 doesn't have breaking changes; 16.02 has some very minor breaking changes Breaking Changes in 2sxc 16.02 API Changes which affect you if you had installed v16.01 with the latest Blog or Mobius In v16.01 we had introduced a new Typed API, which turned out to be not good-enough. This meant we had to rollback some of the changes we had introduced there, API Changes which should really not affect you Various APIs which used to return an IHybridHtmlString now return an IRawHtml This is to sync types with RazorBlade. It should have no effect on any code out there, as the result type is usually dynamic Renamed the type ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicMetadata to ToSic.Sxc.Data.IMetadata This is technically a breaking change, but the type name should never have been used in any razor code, so it shouldn't affect anybody. Renamed ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicField to ToSic.Sxc.Data.IField This is technically a breaking change, but the type name should never have been used in any razor code, so it shouldn't affect anybody. Breaking Changes in 2sxc 16.03 API Changes which affect you if you had installed v16.01/16.02 with the latest Blog or Mobius Base classes were renamed because of confusing ...Pro suffix. RazorPro is now RazorTyped, ApiPro is ApiTyped and CodePro is CodeTyped #3147 Now by default, all access to a property like .String(\"SomeName\") will throw an error in required mode if the field doesn't exist #3138 The .Parents(...) was enhanced to require named parameters (see blog post) #3139 Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v15 We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary V13 did some clean-up. It will rarely affect you, but if you are using the TimelineJs App it will. Breaking Changes in 2sxc 15.00 Tip In summary we've made a lot of internal breaking changes. But for all normal users it will have no effect at all. We believe it will only affect you in these scenarios: If you have a custom DataSource, you will need to make some minor changes and recompile them If you used special, non-public Logging APIs you would need to update your work If you used any undocumented APIs, you will need to check if everything still works API Changes that may affect you DataSource base class was completely refactored see instructions Old static ToSic.Eav.DataSource was removed (deprecated since v13) Internal logging API ILog was completely refactored see instructions Internal object wrappers were completely refactored see instructions TinyMCE Upgrade to v6 Database changes Minor API changes Breaking Updates which probably don't affect anybody SQL changes - minor updates to the Database Internal APIs which were removed Static ToSic.Eav.Data.Builder.AttribBuilder.AddValue(...) Breaking Changes in 2sxc 15.03 Tip In summary we've made a lot of internal breaking changes. But for all normal users it will have no effect at all. We believe it will only affect you in these scenarios: TODO API Changes that may affect you An internal user property IUser.IsDesigner was renamed to IUser.IsSiteDeveloper An internal, deprecated user property IUser.IsAdmin was removed An internal, deprecated user property IUser.IsSuperUser was removed An internal property IUser.Guid was changed from Guid? to Guid The Users DataSource had a property called IncludeSystemAdmins which was changed from bool to string to allow for more options The Users DataSource had a property called RoleIds which returned a non-standard string-array. It has been removed, and the new Roles returns standard related entities. Removed static ToSic.Eav.Data.Build.Entity(...) method which was deprecated in v12 API Changes which should really not affect you These are internal APIs which we changed to make everything more immutable. They should never have been in use outside of the internal code. Changed IValue.Languages from IList to IEnumerable and made it immutable Change IEntity.Attributes from Dictionary<string, IAttribute> to IImmutableDictionary<string, IAttribute> as a step to later make it immutable Removed some old, probably never used APIs on IAttribute<T> such as IAttribute<T>[int[] languageIDs] IAttribute<T>[string] IAttribute<T>[string[]] IAttribute[string[] languageKeys] - was always marked as private Changed the type of Attribute.Type from string to ValueTypes to make it more strongly typed Removed the property Attribute.ControlledType which previously contained the ValueType Breaking Changes in 2sxc 15.06 Tip In summary we've made a lot of internal breaking changes. But for all normal users it will have no effect at all. We believe it will only affect you in these scenarios: TODO API Changes that may affect you on IEntity These were internal APIs which were not publicly documented, but may have been used by some developers. IEntity.GetDraft() was removed to ensure the entity is immutable IEntity.GetPublished() was removed to ensure the entity is immutable Note: GetDraft() and GetPublished() are still available on DynamicEntity in Razor and WebApi. They were only removed on IEntity. Renamed DataSources These data sources had uncommon names, and were renamed to be more consistent. We believe that they were only used in VisualQuery and not in code, so it should not affect you. CsvDataSource is now Csv SerializationConfiguration is now Serialization Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v14 We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary V14 did some clean-up of internal APIs, but otherwise there are no known breaking changes. Note that these changes could be seen as a breaking change for certain users: Change in App Zip Package in v14.08 v14.08 Change in App Data Folder in v14.08 v14.08 Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v13 We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary V13 did some clean-up. It will rarely affect you, but if you are using the TimelineJs App it will. Breaking Changes in 2sxc 13.00 API Changes that may affect you An old, non-DI feature for Inner Content is being deprecated and will be removed in v14 see instructions An old feature for publishing module InstanceData as JSON is removed see instructions An old feature to create DataSources is removed see instructions Two old data-conversion features DataToDictionary and EntitiesToDictionary were removed see instructions Some internal functionality which enabled IEntity objects to convert links containing file:... and page:... has been removed. This only affects special deep code calls on IEntity and does _not affect DynamicEntity objects in Razor see instructions The old feature Eav.Factory.Resolve<T>() was deprecated and will be removed in v14 see instructions The old feature BlockDataSource.Cache.GetContentType(...) was removed see instructions The Dnn Static ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Factory is being deprecated and will be removed in v14 see instructions Major Updates with may affect you The Image Resizer is being replaced with ImageFlow The App containing Site-wide settings is changed to Primary - previously it used the Content app for this. We believe this won't affect many users, as the settings-stack is still very new in v12 Things which probably don't affect anybody SQL changes - minor updates to the Database .net Framework and Dll Updated to Match Dnn 9 Requirements - but still works in Dnn 7.4.2 .net Framework 4.7.2 now required (previously .net Framework 4.5.1) .net Standard 2.0.3 required (previously .net Standard 1.6) Important: This will be referenced in the web.config upon installation Dependency Injection updated to .net core 2.1.1 (previously 1.1) Newtonsoft.Json updated to v10.0.3 Entity Framework updated to 2.1.1 (previously 1.1) - Oqtane is unmodified and uses 3.1.4 Dnn DLLs renamed ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.dll became ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Core.dll for consistency ToSic.SexyContent.WebApi.dll became ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.WebApi.dll ToSic.SexyContent.Razor.dll became ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Razor.dll An internal object ToSic.Eav.Apps.State was removed Internal APIs which were removed Static ToSic.Eav.Data.Builder.AttribBuilder.AddValue(...) Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v12 We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary V12 did a lot of internal rework to get it to run on Oqtane. Almost none of the changes will affect you. Breaking Change Version 12.10 Jquery is completely removed. This shouldn't affect your code, since all old code usually runs in DNN where jQuery is included by default. Breaking Change Version 12.05 V12 adds new properties to Razor and WebAPI which could result in some surprises: Path, Convert, Settings, Resources and DevTools. Especially the new Path and Convert could clash with existing code which had @using System or @using System.IO so the code would just read Path.GetFileName(...) or something. Because of this, we only give the latest classes Custom.Dnn.Razor12, Custom.Dnn.Code12, Custom.Hybrid.Razor12, Custom.Hybrid.Api12 etc. these properties. This means that previous base classes do not have these by design, and we encourage you to move to these latest base classes. Important: 2sxc 12.00 - 12.04 also had some of these properties on ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent as well as ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController. So if you were eager to use these properties but didn't change the base class, you were able to use it. To protect thousands of upgrade-scenarios we had to take them away from the old base classes. Sorry! Possible Breaking Changes We believe nothing broke, but it could be that some commands on EntitiesToDictionary or DataToDictionary were accidentally changed. Pls report so we can fix that. The Link.To(...) now returns safe URLs. This should not be an issue, but in rare cases post-processing of the string returned may expect spaces or something, which are now %20 We disabled old obsolete APIs on the new Razor12, Api12 and Code12 base classes. In case you were using this (not likely) you'll get an error telling you about this. Breaking Change Version 12.04 DynamicEntity now has a property Count because it's a list as well, this could cause issues if a content-type has a property Count DynamicEntity is now always a list. Because of this we removed the DynamicEntityWithList object. We believe the type is never referenced in user code, but if it is, this would be a breaking change. Many parts that prepare Entities returned a Dictionary<string, object> and now return an IDictionary<string, object>. We believe this shouldn't hurt much, since the result would usually be in a var or returend directly to the API for streaming, but in case someone had used explicitly typed code, this will require a minor change Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v11 We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary There were small breaking changes in 11.00 to 11.11 but they were internal so shouldn't affect normal developers. Breaking Changes Version 11.07 - Drop the old edit UI In 11.07 the old edit UI was removed, so customizations for that UI would not be in effect any more. Breaking Changes Version 11.10 - Mainly Dependency Injection In v11.10 we used much more dependency injection than ever before and stopped using static values which were still in the API in many places. Because of this, certain helper objects to create entities or lookup values were changed and their constructors were changed. We invested a lot of time to try to ensure that old APIs still work, but in case you're hit by one of these, make sure you check the DI and switch to resolving the objects using DI. Breaking Changes Version 11.11 - Language Detection Previously the language detection used the Thread culture. Turns out this wasn't reliable because Dnn does some funny stuff (probably historical) which means that API-calls ended up using the language stored in some cookie instead of the one specified by the URL. We changed this, which should be more reliable. But if you were relying on this strange effect, then it may be a breaking change. Internally our tokens were also using the thread culture. When we changed this, we also had to change how tokens pick up the language. In rare cases this may affect you. We changed all tokens to always resolve boolean values to true/false (previously they would have been changed to the current language, like wahr for german). We believe this change is only an improvement, and should ensure that internal resolves in Queries etc. result in reliable output. Breaking Changes Version 11.11 - DataSources: DataSourceConfiguration Note that we also improved the DataSourceConfiguration to an interface IDataSourceConfiguration and documented this. As a side effect the API stays the same, but you will have to recompile your data sources for them to work again - sorry. Breaking Changes Version 11.11.03 - IEntity Values IEntity had a command called Value(fieldName) which was probably never used. The idea used to be that it does language lookup internally, but we refactored this out since it could never be fully reliable because the full language list wasn't known to the IEntity. So we re-purposed the method (assuming it's not used) to just lookup the first occurance of the value. This way it`s useful for configurations and similar which are not multi-language. IEntity also had a Value(fieldname, lookup) method. We are deprecating it, and making the lookup not happen from now on. We believe it was never used. IEntity had a command called PrimaryValue(fieldName) which was probably never ever used, so we're deprecating it. Use Value(fieldName) instead. Breaking Changes Version 11.11.03 - Other UI Toolbar dropped the button and command for item-history, as the history is now part of the edit dialog Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary Version 10 has a lot of small breaking changes because we restructured the internal API so it's consistent when we publish it. All these things shouldn't affect you, because they were internal APIs, but in case it does - here's what we did. Version 10.22 and 10.23 Renamed the RootDataSource and the Interface to IAppRoot Split SOC of the AppRoot DataSource so that caching, Root-Metadata and ListCache is fully separate Since the Logging system now auto-picks up the code lines and names of the methods, we simplified the commands and dropped some parameters. Moved quite a bit of the DataSource objects into sub-objects, again for SOC. Version 10.20-04 (ca. 2019-12-03) Renamed DataTableDataSource to DataTable, old name still works. Renamed ExternalDataDataSource to ExternalData, old name still works. Renamed ToSic.SexyContent.DataSources.ModuleDataSource to ToSic.Sxc.DataSources.CmsBlock, old name still works. Renamed ToSic.Eav.DataSources.VisualQuery.VisualQueryAttribute to ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Queries.VisualQueryAttribute, old name still works. Renamed ToSic.SexyContent.Environment.Dnn7.Factory to ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Factory, old name still works. Renamed ToSic.Eav.DataSources.BaseDataSource to ToSic.Eav.DataSources.DataSourceBase for consistency, old name still works. Moved the LookUp namespaces into the Core DLL Version 10.20-02 (ca. 2019-11-22) More internal changes which shouldn't affect anybody, but make the API ready for public docs... Moved/renamed the internal Eav.AppDataPackage to Eav.Apps.AppState Moved/renamed some internal interfaces like Entity... Did a major change for how Attribute<T> for relationships work. Before they were Attribute<EntityRelationship> and now they are Attribute<IEnumerable<IEntity>>.

Left old name compatible. Moved some extension methods for IEntity from ToSic.Eav.Data.Query to ToSic.Eav.Data Changed Permissions to be strongly typed EntityBased objects Version 10.20.01 (2019-11-12) Internal code now uses the term Header instead of ListContent. External code provides both for backward-compatibility moved internal interfaces for engines (Razor/Token) to final namespaces ToSic.Sxc.Engines IEngine EngineBase ITokenEngine IRazorEngine corrected architecture - some template-management code had slipped into Eav.Apps, was moved back to Sxc.Apps The Template object was moved from Eav.Apps to Sxc.Views and we added an interface IView. We also renamed the internal properti ViewNameInUrl to UrlIdentifier. To correct the API a CmsManager was created extending the AppManager, which is in charge of Views Moving internal stuff related to content blocks IContentBlock from SexyContent.Interfaces to Sxc.Blocks from ToSic.SexyContent.ISxcInstance to ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.IBlockContext actually moved a lot of things there incl. ContentBlock now BlockConfiguration and more - all internal stuff Moving the ToSic.SexyContent.App to ToSic.Sxc.Apps.App In a razor page, we added the preferred Purpose. The old InstancePurpose will still work Placed some things we just moved in 10.20 to a final place - since it's a very recent change, we updated the docs in the 10.20.00 section Changed, but completely internal Some namespaces on SexyContent.ContentBlocks were moved to Sxc.Blocks Version 10.20.00 (2019-11-05) the internal interface IInPageEditingHelpers was moved from ToSic.SexyContent.Interfaces to the namespace ToSic.Sxc.Web the internal interface ILinkHelper was moved to ToSic.Sxc.Web the internal interface IHtmlHelper was moved to ToSic.Sxc.Dnn the property Configuration on dynamic entities was deprecated in 2sxc 4 and removed in 2sxc 10 - we don't think it was ever used moved internal Metadata interfaces (ca. 5) into final namespace ToSic.Eav.Metadata Moved a bunch of internal interfaces which we believe were never used externally from ToSic.Eav.Interfaces to ToSic.Eav.Data ToSic.Eav.Data.IAttribute ToSic.Eav.IAttribute<T> IAttributeBase IAttributeDefinition IChildEntities IContentType IDimension IEntityLight ILanguage IRelationshipManager IValue IValue<T> IValueOfDimension<T> Moved a bunch of internal interfaces which we believe were never used externally from ToSic.Eav.Apps.Interfaces to ToSic.Eav.Apps IApp IAppData IAppDataConfiguration IAppEnvironment IEnvironmentFactory IInstanceInfo IItemListAction IPagePublishing ITenant IZoneMapper the internal namespace ToSic.Eav.ValueProvider was changed to ToSic.Eav.LookUp and inside it we renamed a bunch of internal interfaces and objects which we believe were never used externally Deprecated/Changed, but not broken the internal interface ToSic.SexyContent.IAppAndDataHelpers was renamed to ToSic.Sxc.IDynamicCode but the old interface still exists, so it shouldn't break it was used by Mobius Forms moved ToSic.Eav.Interfaces.IEntity to ToSic.Eav.Data.IEntity - but preserved the old interface for compatibility it was used everywhere Clean-Up, but not broken We're transitioning to the term Header instead of ListContent in templates. The Razor pages and WebApi have this starting now, while old terms still work. Note that we're not creating a HeaderPresentation, because you should use Header.Presentation Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc Version 9 We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Version 9.20.00 (2018-03-04) Minor breaking change in ADAM properties, like Id instead of FolderID which was a leftover of Dnn naming. see full blog post Version 09.08.00 (2017-11-28) Minor breaking change List<IEntity> instead of Dictionary<int, IEntity> on the IDataSource see full blog post Version 09.03.00 (2017-10-08) Breaking change on inconsistent naming ToSic.Eav.IEntity instead of ToSic.Eav.Interfaces.IEntity. see full blog post"

Moved/renamed the internal Eav.AppDataPackage to Eav.Apps.AppState Moved/renamed some internal interfaces like Entity... Did a major change for how Attribute<T> for relationships work. Before they were Attribute<EntityRelationship> and now they are Attribute<IEnumerable<IEntity>>. This also affects Value<EntityRelationship> which is now Value<IEnumerable<IEntity>> Moved Tenant<T> and Container<T> including matching interfaces to Eav.Environment Renamed IAppIdentity to IInAppAndZone and IZoneIdentity to IInZone Renamed ICacheKeyProvider to ICacheKey Renamed CacheChainedIEnumerable<T> to SynchronizedList<T> Moved/Renamed MetadataFor to Eav.Metadata.Target. Left old name compatible. Moved some extension methods for IEntity from ToSic.Eav.Data.Query to ToSic.Eav.Data Changed Permissions to be strongly typed EntityBased objects Version 10.20.01 (2019-11-12) Internal code now uses the term Header instead of ListContent. External code provides both for backward-compatibility moved internal interfaces for engines (Razor/Token) to final namespaces ToSic.Sxc.Engines IEngine EngineBase ITokenEngine IRazorEngine corrected architecture - some template-management code had slipped into Eav.Apps, was moved back to Sxc.Apps The Template object was moved from Eav.Apps to Sxc.Views and we added an interface IView. We also renamed the internal properti ViewNameInUrl to UrlIdentifier. To correct the API a CmsManager was created extending the AppManager, which is in charge of Views Moving internal stuff related to content blocks IContentBlock from SexyContent.Interfaces to Sxc.Blocks from ToSic.SexyContent.ISxcInstance to ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.IBlockContext actually moved a lot of things there incl. ContentBlock now BlockConfiguration and more - all internal stuff Moving the ToSic.SexyContent.App to ToSic.Sxc.Apps.App In a razor page, we added the preferred Purpose. The old InstancePurpose will still work Placed some things we just moved in 10.20 to a final place - since it's a very recent change, we updated the docs in the 10.20.00 section Changed, but completely internal Some namespaces on SexyContent.ContentBlocks were moved to Sxc.Blocks Version 10.20.00 (2019-11-05) the internal interface IInPageEditingHelpers was moved from ToSic.SexyContent.Interfaces to the namespace ToSic.Sxc.Web the internal interface ILinkHelper was moved to ToSic.Sxc.Web the internal interface IHtmlHelper was moved to ToSic.Sxc.Dnn the property Configuration on dynamic entities was deprecated in 2sxc 4 and removed in 2sxc 10 - we don't think it was ever used moved internal Metadata interfaces (ca. 5) into final namespace ToSic.Eav.Metadata Moved a bunch of internal interfaces which we believe were never used externally from ToSic.Eav.Interfaces to ToSic.Eav.Data ToSic.Eav.Data.IAttribute ToSic.Eav.IAttribute<T> IAttributeBase IAttributeDefinition IChildEntities IContentType IDimension IEntityLight ILanguage IRelationshipManager IValue IValue<T> IValueOfDimension<T> Moved a bunch of internal interfaces which we believe were never used externally from ToSic.Eav.Apps.Interfaces to ToSic.Eav.Apps IApp IAppData IAppDataConfiguration IAppEnvironment IEnvironmentFactory IInstanceInfo IItemListAction IPagePublishing ITenant IZoneMapper the internal namespace ToSic.Eav.ValueProvider was changed to ToSic.Eav.LookUp and inside it we renamed a bunch of internal interfaces and objects which we believe were never used externally Deprecated/Changed, but not broken the internal interface ToSic.SexyContent.IAppAndDataHelpers was renamed to ToSic.Sxc.IDynamicCode but the old interface still exists, so it shouldn't break it was used by Mobius Forms moved ToSic.Eav.Interfaces.IEntity to ToSic.Eav.Data.IEntity - but preserved the old interface for compatibility it was used everywhere Clean-Up, but not broken We're transitioning to the term Header instead of ListContent in templates. The Razor pages and WebApi have this starting now, while old terms still work. Note that we're not creating a HeaderPresentation, because you should use Header.Presentation"

    "keywords": "Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v11 We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary There were small breaking changes in 11.00 to 11.11 but they were internal so shouldn't affect normal developers. Breaking Changes Version 11.07 - Drop the old edit UI In 11.07 the old edit UI was removed, so customizations for that UI would not be in effect any more. Breaking Changes Version 11.10 - Mainly Dependency Injection In v11.10 we used much more dependency injection than ever before and stopped using static values which were still in the API in many places. Because of this, certain helper objects to create entities or lookup values were changed and their constructors were changed. We invested a lot of time to try to ensure that old APIs still work, but in case you're hit by one of these, make sure you check the DI and switch to resolving the objects using DI. Breaking Changes Version 11.11 - Language Detection Previously the language detection used the Thread culture. Turns out this wasn't reliable because Dnn does some funny stuff (probably historical) which means that API-calls ended up using the language stored in some cookie instead of the one specified by the URL. We changed this, which should be more reliable. But if you were relying on this strange effect, then it may be a breaking change. Internally our tokens were also using the thread culture. When we changed this, we also had to change how tokens pick up the language. In rare cases this may affect you. We changed all tokens to always resolve boolean values to true/false (previously they would have been changed to the current language, like wahr for german). We believe this change is only an improvement, and should ensure that internal resolves in Queries etc. result in reliable output. Breaking Changes Version 11.11 - DataSources: DataSourceConfiguration Note that we also improved the DataSourceConfiguration to an interface IDataSourceConfiguration and documented this. As a side effect the API stays the same, but you will have to recompile your data sources for them to work again - sorry. Breaking Changes Version 11.11.03 - IEntity Values IEntity had a command called Value(fieldName) which was probably never used. The idea used to be that it does language lookup internally, but we refactored this out since it could never be fully reliable because the full language list wasn't known to the IEntity. So we re-purposed the method (assuming it's not used) to just lookup the first occurance of the value. This way it`s useful for configurations and similar which are not multi-language. IEntity also had a Value(fieldname, lookup) method. We are deprecating it, and making the lookup not happen from now on. We believe it was never used. IEntity had a command called PrimaryValue(fieldName) which was probably never ever used, so we're deprecating it. Use Value(fieldName) instead. Breaking Changes Version 11.11.03 - Other UI Toolbar dropped the button and command for item-history, as the history is now part of the edit dialog"

This shouldn't affect your code, since all old code usually runs in DNN where jQuery is included by default. Changes Version 12.06 LTS No relevant changes Changes Version 12.05 Introduced IJsonService for json serialize/deserialize Introduced IConvertService for simple data-type conversion, also available on the Convert property of Razor12 and Api12 Introduced ToSic.Sxc.Services.ILogService to log messages to the system (Dnn/Oqtane) Introduced IMailService to easily send mails cross-platform Introduced ISecureDataService to use encrypted settings Introduced IRenderService for inner-content rendering (Oqtane code must use this) Published ToSic.Eav.DataFormats.EavLight to better document simple eav data Published IConvertToEavLight as the new standard way to prepare entities for WebAPI serialization. This is meant to replace previous code using objects such as EntitiesToDictionary or DataToDictionary which are now marked as obsolete. New Razor12, Api12 and Code12 Classes now don't support old, obsolete APIs anymore Link.Image now also accepts parameters as a parameter Link.Image and Link.To always create safe urls now (spaces are encoded etc.) Link.To and Link.Image now have a parameter type which can be \"full\" to ensure domains are always added to links (for use in APIs generating RSS etc.) Update to RazorBlade v3.7 Edit.Toolbar now supports condition so that toolbars may or may not be created based on a true/false value Link.Image now also accepts a factor or aspectRatio which is a string like 1:2 or 3/4 AsDynamic(...) now also wraps anonymous objects in quite an amazing way Bugfix: lots of small ones Breaking Change Version 12.05 V12 adds new properties to Razor and WebAPI which could result in some surprises: Path, Convert, Settings, Resources and DevTools. Especially the new Path and Convert could clash with existing code which had @using System or @using System.IO so the code would just read Path.GetFileName(...) or something. Because of this, we only give the latest classes Custom.Dnn.Razor12, Custom.Dnn.Code12, Custom.Hybrid.Razor12, Custom.Hybrid.Api12 etc. these properties. This means that previous base classes do not have these by design, and we encourage you to move to these latest base classes. Important: 2sxc 12.00 - 12.04 also had some of these properties on ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent as well as ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController. So if you were eager to use these properties but didn't change the base class, you were able to use it. To protect thousands of upgrade-scenarios we had to take them away from the old base classes. Sorry! Possible Breaking Changes We believe nothing broke, but it could be that some commands on EntitiesToDictionary or DataToDictionary were accidentally changed. Pls report so we can fix that. The Link.To(...) now returns safe URLs. This should not be an issue, but in rare cases post-processing of the string returned may expect spaces or something, which are now %20 We disabled old obsolete APIs on the new Razor12, Api12 and Code12 base classes. In case you were using this (not likely) you'll get an error telling you about this. Changes Version 12.04 incl 12.03 which was not officially released Settings Stack and Resources Stack added, and the Settings / Resources object now have this Global Settings.Images.xxx settings defined for Content, Screen, Lightbox and Section Global Settings.Resources.xxx defined for fancybox3, fancybox4, bootstrap4, bootstrap5 Link.Image API created to support predefined sizes/resize modes etc. Created feature where DynamicEntities can browse to sub-items using their identifier (used for Settings.Images.Content where Content is actually the title of a sub-entity) Added debug-feature for DynamicEntity get String-Dropdown inputs now have a value-key presets option (instead of the key-value which was flaky) and added support for escaping special characters #Oqtane 2.2 support added Introduced Monaco (VS-Code online) editor for beta-testing source-editing Breaking Change Version 12.04 DynamicEntity now has a property Count because it's a list as well, this could cause issues if a content-type has a property Count DynamicEntity is now always a list. Because of this we removed the DynamicEntityWithList object. We believe the type is never referenced in user code, but if it is, this would be a breaking change. Many parts that prepare Entities returned a Dictionary<string, object> and now return an IDictionary<string, object>. We believe this shouldn't hurt much, since the result would usually be in a var or returend directly to the API for streaming, but in case someone had used explicitly typed code, this will require a minor change Changes Version 12.02 Formulas feature finalized DynamicEntityStack object created Hybrid IPageService created with Activate and similar features CmsContext was enhanced with View information Content-Type icons can now be stored in the app with an [App:Path]/image.jpg style reference Enabled view-configuration to configure search behavior incl. not-to-index or what streams should be indexed turnOn created / deployed #Oqtane 2.1 support added in 2sxc 12.02.01 Changes Version 12.00 Todo"

The Link.To(...) now returns safe URLs.

Breaking Change Version 12.04 DynamicEntity now has a property Count because it's a list as well, this could cause issues if a content-type has a property Count DynamicEntity is now always a list. Because of this we removed the DynamicEntityWithList object. We believe the type is never referenced in user code, but if it is, this would be a breaking change. Many parts that prepare Entities returned a Dictionary<string, object> and now return an IDictionary<string, object>.

This shouldn't affect your code, since all old code usually runs in DNN where jQuery is included by default. Changes Version 12.06 LTS No relevant changes Changes Version 12.05 Introduced IJsonService for json serialize/deserialize Introduced IConvertService for simple data-type conversion, also available on the Convert property of Razor12 and Api12 Introduced ToSic.Sxc.Services.ILogService to log messages to the system (Dnn/Oqtane) Introduced IMailService to easily send mails cross-platform Introduced ISecureDataService to use encrypted settings Introduced IRenderService for inner-content rendering (Oqtane code must use this) Published ToSic.Eav.DataFormats.EavLight to better document simple eav data Published IConvertToEavLight as the new standard way to prepare entities for WebAPI serialization. This is meant to replace previous code using objects such as EntitiesToDictionary or DataToDictionary which are now marked as obsolete. New Razor12, Api12 and Code12 Classes now don't support old, obsolete APIs anymore Link.Image now also accepts parameters as a parameter Link.Image and Link.To always create safe urls now (spaces are encoded etc.) Link.To and Link.Image now have a parameter type which can be \"full\" to ensure domains are always added to links (for use in APIs generating RSS etc.) Update to RazorBlade v3.7 Edit.Toolbar now supports condition so that toolbars may or may not be created based on a true/false value Link.Image now also accepts a factor or aspectRatio which is a string like 1:2 or 3/4 AsDynamic(...) now also wraps anonymous objects in quite an amazing way Bugfix: lots of small ones Breaking Change Version 12.05 V12 adds new properties to Razor and WebAPI which could result in some surprises: Path, Convert, Settings, Resources and DevTools. Especially the new Path and Convert could clash with existing code which had @using System or @using System.IO so the code would just read Path.GetFileName(...) or something. Because of this, we only give the latest classes Custom.Dnn.Razor12, Custom.Dnn.Code12, Custom.Hybrid.Razor12, Custom.Hybrid.Api12 etc. these properties. This means that previous base classes do not have these by design, and we encourage you to move to these latest base classes.

Unfortunately it was in the original Mobius-Forms so we are giving it a 1 year deprecation, and will be fully removed it v15.

Because of this, you can actually just skip gotting the content-type, and just use the name directly. To fix this, just use the config.ContentTypeName instead of the type.Name OR upgrade to a newer Mobius. If you need the type for other uses, best create an issue on GitHub.

They were not used much, but if you have code which used this, here's how to fix any code in production. The ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Factory.[various]() are being deprecated, and will be removed in v14. Reason for Removal 2sxc used to be the first and only Module in Dnn which supported Dependency Injection, so there was a need to patch this in somehow. The solution we used was to have static object ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Factory which managed this, but this is actually bad practice and encourages bad code. This was mainly used in WebForms, specifically Skins/Themes to access 2sxc data, but we've created a much better replacement using: IDynamicCodeService IRenderService History - How it Used to Work Previously you could write code like this in your ascx Theme: <%@ Import Namespace=\"System.Linq\" %> <script runat=\"server\"> public string OldFactoryUse() { var appId = 6; var app = ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Factory.App(appId); var questions = app.Data[\"Question\"]; var title = questions.First().GetBestValue(\"EntityTitle\"); return \"Questions: \" + questions.Count() + \": First Title:\" + title; } public string OldRender() { var pageId = 21; var moduleId = 380; var block = ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Factory.CmsBlock(pageId, moduleId); var result = block.Render(); return result; } public string OldDynamicCode() { var pageId = 21; var moduleId = 380; var blockBuilder = ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Factory.CmsBlock(pageId, moduleId); var dynCode = ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Factory.DynamicCode(blockBuilder); var questions = dynCode.App.Data[\"Question\"]; var title = dynCode.AsDynamic(questions.First()).EntityTitle; return \"Questions: \" + questions.Count() + \": First Title:\" + title; } </script> What we Changed In 2sxc 13.00 we integrated our Dependency Injection with the Dnn 9.4+ built-in Dependency Injection. This allows you to get 2sxc services from DI. In 2sxc 13.02 we created the IDynamicCodeService which is a replacement for the old Factory. You must use this from now on. Reasons for Change The newer code may seem a bit more complex, but you'll see in the API docs that we've actually improved the API. The reason the code looks so messy is because Dnn doesn't fully embrace Dependency Injection yet, so to get it, you need that complex looking var codeSvc = HttpContext.Current.GetScope().ServiceProvider.GetService<IDynamicCodeService>(); We hope and believe that Dnn will improve on this soon. Upgrade to Newer functionality So the previous example would look like this: <%@ Import Namespace=\"System.Linq\" %> <%@ Import Namespace=\"DotNetNuke.Common.Extensions\" %> <%@ Import Namespace=\"Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection\" %> <%@ Import Namespace=\"ToSic.Sxc.Services\" %> <script runat=\"server\"> public IServiceProvider ServiceProvider { get { return HttpContext.Current.GetScope().ServiceProvider; }} public string NewApp() { var codeSvc = ServiceProvider.GetService<IDynamicCodeService>(); var app = codeSvc.App(appId: 6); var questions = app.Data[\"Question\"]; var title = questions.First().GetBestValue(\"EntityTitle\"); return \"Questions: \" + questions.Count() + \": First Title:\" + title; } public string NewRender() { var renderSvc = ServiceProvider.GetService<IRenderService>(); var result = renderSvc.Module(pageId: 21, moduleId: 380); return result.ToString(); } public string NewDynamicCode() { var pageId = 21; var moduleId = 380; var codeSvc = ServiceProvider.GetService<IDynamicCodeService>(); var dynCode = codeSvc.OfModule(pageId, moduleId); var questions = dynCode.App.Data[\"Question\"]; var title = dynCode.AsDynamic(questions.First()).EntityTitle; return \"Questions: \" + questions.Count() + \": First Title:\" + title; } </script> If you were using this from outside of 2sxc Razor / WebApi, you will need to use the Dnn specific DependencyInjection (available in Dnn 9.4+).

But it was in the official docs, so there may have been a few users who picked this up. History - How it Used to Work Previously you could write code like this in your Razor: var convertService = ToSic.Eav.Factory.Resolve<IConvertService>(); What we Changed In 2sxc 11.11 we introduced the GetService<T>() (docs) which takes care of this. Please use this from now on. The old API will be disabled disabled and will show an error pointing to this documentation. Upgrade to Newer functionality So the previous example would look like this: var convertService = GetService<IConvertService>(); If you were using this from outside of 2sxc Razor / WebApi, you will need to use the Dnn specific DependencyInjection (available in Dnn 9.4+). History Introduced in 2sxc 7 with Dependency Injection based on .net Standard 1.6 Deprecated in 2sxc 13 with the integration of Dnn 9.4 DI Planned for full removal in 2sxc 14 ca. middle of 2022 Shortlink to here: https://go.2sxc.org/brc-13-eav-factory"

They were not used much, but if you have code which used this, here's how to fix any code in production. Specifically, features were removed which convert special file:... and page:... links on the IEntity: Important You are probably not affected This only affects special code calls which first get an IEntity and then uses the GetBestValue expecting the link to convert. Almost all Razor / WebApi code uses Dynamic Entities (with AsDynamic(...)), and these cases will continue to work as expected. Reason for Removal These features were removed because they relied on objects which need Dependency Injection, and calling this object directly cannot give us DI. These features were rarely used, and newer mechanisms are much more appropriate than that old stuff. History - How it Used to Work A long time ago we introduced the ability to store links like file:73 or page:42. At that time, we looked up the link in APIs of the cached object (the IEntity). This turned out to be a bad idea, because the cached object doesn't have access to the current Site information, which is needed to lookup these real links. What we Changed A long time ago we already ensured that the Dynamic Entity will do this lookup, and not rely on the inner APIs to do this. So all code which uses AsDynamic(...).SomeLinkProperty will always work as expected. But in rare cases you may have been getting the SomeLinkProperty from the IEntity. This will now not throw an error, but simply not lookup the link any more. So if you end up getting links like this, you are probably affected: <a href=\"file:74\">click here</a> Upgrade to Newer functionality Just make sure you always access the properties using the Dynamic Entity - so if you had an IEntity before, wrap it into AsDynamic(...) first.

They were not used much, but if you have code which used this, here's how to fix any code in production. Specifically, three features were removed: The ability to publish Module Instance Data directly The ability to configure this in the View settings The JS API which was optimized to process the resulting data in a fairly untypical way Reason for Removal These features were removed because they were almost never used, and newer mechanisms are much more appropriate than that old stuff. History - How it Used to Work 2sxc V3 (ca. 2013) introduced a feature where a Module could publish the data it was also showing on a normal screen as a WebApi / JSON call. It was required that a view activates this feature to ensure that it doesn't happen by accident. The settings in the view were like this (example from the TimelineJs App): Go to the view configuration The old deprecated settings Enable data publishing (which opened the data for JS) The streams which were to be published Note that the stream Default is still called Default today, but ListContent is usually called Header today. Once this was setup, there was a way to get this data through a WebApi call. From v3 to ca. v6 there was a call which actually went through the Dnn Page (so it was slow) V6 to ca. v11 it used a call to app-sys/AppContent/GetContentBlockData Later there was a special WebApi call to app/auto/InstanceData which did the same thing The format of the response was a bit special, specifically it looked like this (TimelineJs example): The call to InstanceData The data which was on a special List sub-object To complement this, there was a JS-API which worked as follows: // Process each Timeline DOM-element on the page $(\".timeline-embed\").each(function() { // Define our timeline element, get moduleId var timeLineElement = $(this); var sxc = $2sxc(this); // Load the data from the 2SexyContent module and define a callback sxc.data.on(\"load\", function (source, data) { processDataAndCreateTimeline(source, data, sxc.id, timeLineElement) }).load(); }); Specifically, it used a data.on call to kind of say: on load get the data from the current module. The resulting data was then used in the JS - for example like this in TimelineJS: // what should happen on loading of the data: function processDataAndCreateTimeline (data, moduleId, timeLineElement) { // Old code using the `in`, the `ListContent` and `.List[...]` stream var content = data.in.Default.List; var listContent = data.in.ListContent.List[0]; var timelineData = getTimelineData(moduleId, content, listContent); ... Upgrade to Newer functionality Tip Below you'll find instructions how to create the same functionality using Visual Query and newer JS APIs. But: In many cases you may actually want a different solution, because Visual Query is very powerful and may provide other ways to get you the data you need. Step 1: Create Query which Gets Instance Data This creates a Query API call which gets the same data as before, but in a newer API and newer standard. Create the Query - in our example we'll call it ModuleData After doing this, you have created a query which returns the same data as before, with 2 important differences: The stream ListContent is now called Header There are no permissions configured yet for anonymous users to access the query Step 2: Update the JS code to use the Query instead of the .data We have updated the TimelineJS code to use the new fetchJson api - see docs: // Process each Timeline DOM-element on the page $(\".timeline-embed\").each(function() { // Define our timeline element, get moduleId var timeLineElement = $(this); var sxc = $2sxc(this); // New version using fetch and the default Query we just created sxc.webApi.fetchJson('app/auto/query/ModuleData') .then((data) => processDataAndCreateTimeline(data, sxc.id, timeLineElement)); }); In addition, the data returned is a simpler. Specifically three things are now different: it doesn't have a level in it doesn't need the use .List in our new Query the Header is in a stream Header and not ListContent This would be the modified code in TimelineJs: function processDataAndCreateTimeline (data, moduleId, timeLineElement) { // Re-format streams that are contained in data var content = data.Default; var listContent = data.Header[0]; var timelineData = getTimelineData(moduleId, content, listContent); ... Step 3: Set Query Permissions After doing Step 1 & 2 you will have a working solution, but only super-users (host-users) can use the query because the read-permissions have not yet been configured.

The problems: the web.config grows to be very large future upgrades of 2sxc which need to modify the bindings could end up modifying a binding, but other unmodified bindings could take precedence third party modules which also modify assembly bindings could modify the wrong bindings The following bindings were added repeatedly: <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions\" publicKeyToken=\"adb9793829ddae60\" /> <codeBase version=\"2.2.0.0\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions\" publicKeyToken=\"adb9793829ddae60\" /> <codeBase version=\"2.2.0.0\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives\" publicKeyToken=\"adb9793829ddae60\" /> <codeBase version=\"2.2.0.0\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Memory\" publicKeyToken=\"cc7b13ffcd2ddd51\" /> <codeBase version=\"4.0.1.1\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\System.Memory.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Numerics.Vectors\" publicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" /> <codeBase version=\"4.1.4.0\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\System.Numerics.Vectors.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe\" publicKeyToken=\"b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" /> <codeBase version=\"4.0.4.1\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions\" publicKeyToken=\"adb9793829ddae60\" /> <codeBase version=\"2.2.0.0\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection\" publicKeyToken=\"adb9793829ddae60\" /> <codeBase version=\"2.2.0.0\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Abstractions\" publicKeyToken=\"adb9793829ddae60\" /> <codeBase version=\"2.2.0.0\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Abstractions.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions\" publicKeyToken=\"adb9793829ddae60\" /> <codeBase version=\"2.2.0.0\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> <dependentAssembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\"> <assemblyIdentity name=\"Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream\" publicKeyToken=\"31bf3856ad364e35\" /> <codeBase version=\"1.2.2.0\" href=\"bin\\Imageflow\\Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream.dll\" /> </dependentAssembly> This assemblyBinding fragment can be repeated many times, depending on the amount of times you upgraded 2sxc (since v13.04 till v14.02), what DNN version you're using and what 3rd party modules you have. While testing this issue, we did not noticed anything that is breaking dnn and 2sxc because .NET Framework will follow only first occurrence of assembly binding for specified assembly in web.config. From functional point of view, second and any other assembly binding for the same specified assembly will be ignored by .NET Framework. Still it is not nice to have unnecessary assembly binding copies in web.config. For v13.04-v14.02. recommendation is that you manually remove unnecessary bindings in web.config to keep it clean. Upgrade to v14.03 (or latter version) will auto-fix this. Am I affected?

    "keywords": "Fix Breaking Change DataSource in v15 Keywords: #DataSource #CustomDataSource 2sxc/EAV has a powerful extension system called DataSource which allows you to create new data providers. We completely reworked object hierarchy and Dependency Injection. Because of this, any custom DataSource will have to be adjusted and recompiled. Reason for Change The DataSource concept was created in times before Dependency Injection. This means that the architecture was very problematic, and we had a lot of hacky implementations to make it work. History - How it Used to Work Previously all DataSources inherited from ToSic.Eav.DataSources.DataSourceBase ToSic.Eav.DataSources.ExternalData ...from another data source These had empty constructors, so your DataSource could also have an empty constructor. Internally it still needed some helper objects which were only available because a special factory added them later on. What we Changed 1. Base Class with Parameters in Constructor The base class was renamed to ToSic.Eav.DataSources.DataSource The base class now always expects 2 parameters in the constructor Dependencies dependencies - type TODO string logName - for any messages which appear in Insights To make this work, any inheriting class must implement a minimal constructor like this: class MyDataSource { // Constructor public MyDataSource(Dependencies dependencies): base(dependencies, $\"My.DataSc\") { //... } } 2. Changes in Logging If your DataSource does any logging, see also breaking changes in logging 3. Removed Old Base Classes Some old base classes may have still been in use, but because the code must be recompiled anyhow we decided to remove these. These are the classes and their replacement: ToSic.Eav.DataSources.BaseDataSource - > DataSource ToSic.Eav.DataSources.DataTableDataSource -> ToSic.Eav.DataSources.DataTable ToSic.Eav.DataSources.ExternalDataDataSource: ToSic.Eav.DataSources.ExternalData ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SqlDataSource: ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Sql Also ToSic.Eav.DataSources.VisualQuery.VisualQueryAttribute -> DataSources.Queries.VisualQueryAttribute 4. Changes in Provide signature Previously there were many Provide(...) methods but we reduced it to 2 and renamed to ProvideOut for better readability. Now you should use: ProvideOut(function) or the named stream ProvideOut(function, \"MyStream\") Where function can be () => IEnumerable<IEntity> () => IImmutableList<IEntity> They will behave the same, but providing an IImmutableList is slightly more performant. 5. Changes in how Configuration is retrieved Now it uses the attribute [Configuration] and Configuration.GetThis() and Configuration.SetThis(value). 6. Changes in VisualQuery attribute GlobalName is now NameId PreviousNames is now NameIds 7. Changes in Error handling Use TryGetIn() to see if an in-stream exists and get the data TODO: History Introduced ca. 2sxc 5 Completely reworked in 2sxc/eav 15"

    "title": "Fix Breaking Change Logging in v15 | 2sxc 16 / EAV 16",
    "keywords": "Fix Breaking Change Logging in v15 Keywords: #Logging #DataSources 2sxc has a powerful logging system which tracks what happens in a structure that matches code calls. This was changed extensively. Tip This change should not affect any normal Razor / WebApi etc. code in any way. It will only affect compiled code, or if you were using non-public APIs Reason for Change We wanted to make this part of code more reusable and plan to publish a Nuget package. For this it must be a standalone component. There were various cases were the log could be null, which would result in errors just because of logging. We wanted to make sure that logging can never break the code. To make the logs match the call-stack, the log objects must be attached to each other. This always dependend on perfect programming, so we wanted it to be more robust. History - How it Used to Work Previously all this came from the following base interfaces / classes ToSic.Eav.Logging.ILog ToSic.Eav.Logging.Log ToSic.Eav.Logging.IHasLog ToSic.Eav.Logging.HasLog Almost every relevant object in 2sxc inherited from these or implemented them. In addition, the API to add logs was - just as an example: Log.Add(\"Some message\"); These methods were methods of ILog, so they were part of the object. If for some reason the Log object was null, this would result in an exception. What we Changed 1. Move to ToSic.Lib.Core In 2sxc 15 we introduced a new DLL ToSic.Lib.Core. It contains very fundamental parts such as Logging and Dependency Injection Helpers. 👉🏽 All classes now inherit from this. If you had any compiled code, it would need to be recompiled. We then changed almost all logging commands to be Extension Methods. By doing this, we could make all calls null safe, so if the Log object is null, the call will not do anything. This means, that calling anything on the Log object requires you to add the namespace ToSic.Lib.Logging: using ToSic.Lib.Logging; Log.A(\"some message); 2. New ICodeLog for Dynamic Code Logging We believe that any Razor or WebApi should have a simpler logging mechanism which doesn't need much documentation or learning. Because of this, we created a new ICodeLog which still has very simple Add(...) methods. This will be what the Log property of every Razor and WebApi will return. So they will not be ILog but ICodeLog. This should also ensure that any apps which previously used Add(...) will continue to work. History Introduced ca. 2sxc 9 Completely reworked in 2sxc/eav 15"

They were not used much, but if you have code which used this, here's how to fix any code in production. These two commands for rendering Inner Content are being deprecated and will be removed in v14. In v13 it was moved to the Dnn DLL because it shoudn't be used anywhere else. ToSic.SexyContent.ContentBlocks.One(...) ToSic.SexyContent.ContentBlocks.All(...) ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.Render.One(...) ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.Render.All(...) Reason for Removal 2sxc used to not have Dependency Injection so there were some static APIs which we provided. But this is bad practice and causes a lot of difficulty to keep everything working. The newer APIs use Services and Dependency Injection and do what they should. History - How it Used to Work Previously you could write code like this in your Razor: @using ToSic.Sxc.Blocks; // some code @Render.All(someEntity, field: \"AnswerInnerContent\", merge: someEntity.Answer) What we Changed In 2sxc 11.11 we introduced the GetService<T>() (docs) which provides proper DI. We also introduced a ToSic.Sxc.Services.IRenderService which should replace these commands - see docs. Please use this from now on. The old API will continue to work for a while but show errors in the insight. Upgrade to Newer functionality So the previous example would look like this: @using ToSic.Sxc.Services; // some code var renderSvc = GetService<IRenderService>(); @renderSvc.All(someEntity, field: \"AnswerInnerContent\", merge: someEntity.Answer) History Introduced ToSic.SexyContent.ContentBlocks ca. 2sxc 5 Introduced better name but still non-DI implementation called ToSic.Sxc.ContentBlocks ca. 2sxc 7 New IRenderService introduced in 2sxc 11 and 12 Deprecated in 2sxc 13 Planned for full removal in 2sxc 14 ca. middle of 2022 Shortlink to here: https://go.2sxc.org/brc-13-static-render"

We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Summary V16.00 doesn't have breaking changes; 16.02 has some very minor breaking changes Breaking Changes in 2sxc 16.02 API Changes which affect you if you had installed v16.01 with the latest Blog or Mobius In v16.01 we had introduced a new Typed API, which turned out to be not good-enough. This meant we had to rollback some of the changes we had introduced there, API Changes which should really not affect you Various APIs which used to return an IHybridHtmlString now return an IRawHtml This is to sync types with RazorBlade. It should have no effect on any code out there, as the result type is usually dynamic Renamed the type ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicMetadata to ToSic.Sxc.Data.IMetadata This is technically a breaking change, but the type name should never have been used in any razor code, so it shouldn't affect anybody. Renamed ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicField to ToSic.Sxc.Data.IField This is technically a breaking change, but the type name should never have been used in any razor code, so it shouldn't affect anybody. Breaking Changes in 2sxc 16.03 API Changes which affect you if you had installed v16.01/16.02 with the latest Blog or Mobius Base classes were renamed because of confusing ...Pro suffix. RazorPro is now RazorTyped, ApiPro is ApiTyped and CodePro is CodeTyped #3147 Now by default, all access to a property like .String(\"SomeName\") will throw an error in required mode if the field doesn't exist #3138 The .Parents(...) was enhanced to require named parameters (see blog post) #3139"

    "keywords": "Deprecation Policy & Breaking Changes Tip 2sxc is really, really stable. Upgrades usually don't cause any breaking changes at all. Despite this, it's important that 2sxc can become better, without becoming confusing. Because of this, we have some policies how to achieve this. Rule #1: Public APIs Remain Stable Public APIs remain stable across releases, so old code / Razor will continue to work. Public APIs include Public REST APIs Public C# APIs used in Razor and WebAPI Controllers Note that public APIs in code are marked as such. Note also that internal APIs can change without warning, as you can use them, but the burden of keeping up with the changes is up to you. If you use these, you will have to spend more time testing an upgrade. Rule #2: New Features go Together Many new features will only be available if you are working in a newer base class. This will aften make older APIs unavailable, so we can phase them out. Example: The new AsList(...) command is only available on the newer base classes like Custom.Razor12 The old Elements API will not be available on the newer base classes Rule #3: Deprecations are Warned at Runtime (new in v13) V13 added a new feature: Deprecation warnings. This works as follows: APIs that are going to be deprecated are internally going to raise messages if they are still in use You can see these messages in Insights and soon also in the System dialogs Deprecated APIs will follow this process: Warn about deprecation for at least 1 full version, if possible 2 versions of 2sxc (so ca. 12 months) We'll try to include an information, if and when the API will be removed We'll also try to include information for what API should be used instead. If removing the API is important for future features, we will remove it after the warned period If removal is not necessary We'll remove them from the public docs we'll leave them in but stop testing them - so they may stop working without us knowing about it Note that depending on how much we believe the old APIs have been used, we will usually also remove them from the docs once they are deprecated. Only in rare cases where an API is widely used will we keep it in the docs, but clearly communicate that it's obsolete and that it shouldn't be used any more.

    "keywords": "Content Security Policy (CSP) Basics Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security policy that helps you to protect your web application from cross-site scripting attacks. This page should help you understand what it is and how it works. Here's just a quick example of CSP in action: The Need for CSP There is always a risk that the visitor will see content which you didn't intend. It could happen because your server was hacked, but there are many other ways to make this happen which are outside of your control. This content-insecurity places your visitor at a very high risk of being compromised or redirected. Or it's possible that actions are performed as the current user without their consent. Here some basic examples: Example: URL Injection for XSS Your website has a thank-you page which shows the name from the url like ?name=John Doe. When you made it, you expected to show Thank you John Doe. But smart people figured out, that giving it ?name=<script>alert('Hello')</script> would also work. This injection in many flavors BTW: A few years ago even 2sxc had a small loophole which allowed this. This looks harmless - what can an alert do? As every hacker will tell you, the alert is just the PoC. Once it works, the rest will follow. Example: CSS Attacks You thought CSS was harmless, right? Nyet. If an attacker can manipulate CSS on a page, they can do things like move important links to other locations and make them invisible. This way you can trick people into performing actions they are not aware of. Example: Hack Attacks Every DNN Website loads a copy of jQuery located in a very specific folder. A hacker figured out that it is possible to modify this file using a security loophole. Now that file also loads additional files from another server. Example: JavaScript inside an SVG Your editor just replaced an image on the page, without knowing it contains a JavaScript... Example: JavaScript inject through CDN Your website may load a script such as the old AngularJS from a CDN. In many such cases, tweaking the url or cookie can cause it to load more JavaScripts from other sources. What is CSP? CSP stands for Content Security Policy and it sets rules (policies) which are enforced by the browser. Think of CSP as invisible instructions (HTTP headers) for your browser. All modern browsers understand these instructions. Of course it assumes the browser is friendly - because a user being attacked won't try to actively disable it. With CSP you can set rules such as: Never execute any JavaScript Only load CSS files which are from my server Only load images and fonts from my server Never run on-click javascripts Why does Content-Security-Policy use HTTP Headers? The headers can only be set by the server delivering the content. This means it's fairly tamper proof. For example, JavaScript cannot modify it. This is really important, because this is mostly used when something unexpected compromises your website. There are two main headers used by CSP Content-Security-Policy this will set the rules for the current page/request Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only this is for development to see what the browser would do with the rules Important: You can only use one of these headers at a time. Warning Technically the Content-Security-Policy header could also be set using a <meta> tag. But not the Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only. Many security experts regard the meta-tag as a security risk, so we highly recommended against doing this. In addition, you could end up with CSP in HTTP headers and meta-tags, which will confuse everybody. You will also need the ...-Report-Only during setup, which cannot be done using the meta-tag. So for simplicity all the documentations here assume HTTP-headers. The Four Types of Whitelisting You can just allow everything (not a good idea) You can explicitly allow certain protocols like https:/data:, domains, files or features like unsafe-eval You can allow an inline code/style using a nonce You can allow an inline code/style using a hash The first two are probably obvious, but the nonce and hash could use some help... What is a Nonce? A nonce is a random string which is used to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. It basically works like this: <script nonce=\"random123\"> alert('Hello'); </script> Obviously this nonce must change on every single request! The final piece of the puzzle would be an http header like this: Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-random123' What is a Hash? Instead of using a nonce you can also write a script and calculate the hash of it. <script> alert('hello world!'); </script> Now you would mention this hash in the header: Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'sha256-VAqTxgfXYRCLFYN1tICr/TFOgCNcl16bsv4r8weidBc=' Warning: Nonce and Hashes disable unsafe-inline This may come as a surprise but it's important. As soon as you specify a nonce or a hash, you can't use unsafe-inline. Meaning you can add it, but it will be ignored. This is because it's kind of a replacement; older browsers would then process unsafe-inline and newer ones would ignore it.

    "keywords": "Content Security Policy (CSP) Best Practices Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security policy that helps you to protect your web application from cross-site scripting attacks. There are many ways you can setup CSP, but it is easier if the entire setup is geared towards this goal. JavaScript CSP Best Practices JS: Avoid eval and other Stupid Stuff This is fairly basic: don't use eval in your code. JS: Avoid any JS in the Page Any In-Page JS will either force you to use lax security rules or require a lot of whitelisting using nonce or hashes. We recommend that you avoid this alltogether. Place all your code in external JS files which are on the same server (rule: self). Then use turnOn to start the code. turnOn will also help you pass parameters like the current ModuleId to the script, in case you need it. CSP Configuration Best Practices Use Comments to Document your CSP In the Settings you can use comments with lines beginning with // to document your CSP. It will make your work easier and help others who make changes in the future. // This will apply to all ...-src all-src: 'self' https: Use Multiple Lines All rules will be merged in the end, so in many cases it's better to have rules on multiple lines. // This is for the image gallery script-src https://some-cdn.com/ // This is for jQuery script-src https://some-other-cdn.com/ Use all-src 2sxc has a special all-src rule which you should use for 'self' or https: rules. You should use these at global/site level, because it ensures that any further rules from Apps or other sources won't break your site. Avoid 'nonce-...' and 'sha256-...' Policies 'nonce-...' and 'sha256-...' policies are great for allowing a specific inline bit of script or CSS. But they have a huge side-effect: they automatically disable the 'unsafe-inline' rule. Because of this, you should avoid using these policies, as most Dnn/Oqtane sites will have other scripts which are outside of your control, so you will typically need unsafe-inline. Warning If any of these policies are used, it automatically disables the 'unsafe-inline' rule. This is how CSP works. Be as Local as Possible Rules which should only be used in a specific App should be on that App, not on the site. Rules which only apply to a specific razor page should ideally also be on that page only. Production / Operations Reporting Use a Reporting Server Even if you think you're done, make sure to setup a reporting server. You can get free system from Report-URI. This will allow you to monitor if your site is being compromised - or if you forgot to set some rules, which result in the site breaking."

The difference is that all source directives (even if already specified) will inherit the set values on all-src. default-src Defines the allowed resources such for fetching JavaScript, Images, CSS, Fonts, AJAX requests, Frames, HTML5 Media.

    "keywords": "Content Security Policy (CSP) Guide for 2sxc, Dnn and Oqtane Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security policy that helps you to protect your web application from cross-site scripting attacks. In this guide we'll give you step-by-step instructions how to harden a website in no time. With a bit of practice you can harden a DNN with Content-Security-Policy in one to two hours 🚀. 🎬 Before you start, be sure you've read the background, parts and best-practices. General Process Plan and prepare Setup CSP for anonymous users in reporting-only-mode with a reporting-server Setup CSP for other users - reporting-only Go productive Monitor for a few days Switch to full-mode CSP Preparations Planning CSP Think before you act Some choices made ahead of time will save you time and effort later. Will you make different CSP rules for admins and anonymous users? Will you use a reporting-server? Are you doing this just to \"tick the box, yes we did it\" or do you want it as secure as possible? Tip We highly suggest you segment this by users. That will allow you to make much stricter rules for anonymous users and less strict for admins. This also gives you a better score in most penetration tests, because they will evaluate the rules for anonymous users. In addition, we suggest you ask yourself these questions ahead of time, because it will make it easier to hand off work: When you have a situation where a code-change would let you make the rule more strict, will you make the code change, or use a lax rule? When you have CDN resources, will you want to whitelist them, or move them to your server? If you have resources from CDNs, will you whitelist the entire CDNs or just these resources? Prepare / Harden a Site for CSP Before you try to configure CSP it's best to have a good setup which makes it more secure. Tip If you follow these recommendations, you will be able to have much stricter policies. If you don't, you can still activate CSP but will need a much laxer setup. Rework your Skins / Apps to match a secure architecture, following the best practices. Things such as: Get rid of unused js/css code/files Reduce or better still, remove all jQuery dependent code (especially for anonymous users) Reduce all CDN references to as few as possible Place all your inline scripts and styles in files Change all inline onclick or href:javascript:... to be bound by the loaded code Use turnOn to couple the JS with Razor-data such as the ModuleId Use IPageService.Activate(...) and IPageService.AssetAttributes(...) wherever possible Tip All the latest standard 2sxc apps implement all these best practices. If you still have older Apps, we suggest you install the latest on another server and copy the parts you need. Prepare for Monitoring Once you've deployed CSP you should get notified of any violations. The idea is that violations could just be a sign that something wasn't configured correctly and you may have missed this. There are some cool online services which can do this, like https://report-uri.com/. So we highly recommend you get an account to use for monitoring. Develop CSP Rules General Pattern Always do dry-run tests first Create a new Dev policy and set it to Report-Only Test it using ?csp=dev in the url Choose to start restrictive or lax either start restrictive and open up the rules step-by-step or start with lax rules and tighten step-by-step Once it works, apply to production as ...-Report-Only Repeat with other user roles Dry-Run Without Enforcing Policies First you must enable the dev-feature. Now you can test the policy by adding ?csp=dev to any page. It will work with any login - as soon as you add the parameter, it will use the Dev settings. This is how the dev settings could look: Browser Setup You will want to have a logged-in window to make configuration changes, and another window to test the policy. You can either use two browsers (chrome+canary, chrome+firefox, firefox+edge, etc.) or a single browser with anonymous/guest modes to have different login states. As we're testing this, you will always need to add ?csp=dev to the url you're testing. Tip In the window where you make the configuration, use Ctl+S to just save and not close the widow. This will make it much faster to try various setups. Tip During development, please disable LightSpeed Cache as it may cache some settings, making it hard to debug. Strict-First Method (recommended) With Strict-First you start with very strict rules in ...-Report-Only mode. You will then review the errors you see in the browsers F12 console. Then you will loosen up the rules step-by-step. Lax-First Method The Lax-First method assumes that you start with rules that allow everything, then you tighten them up step-by-step. Here's an example of a very lax rule set, taken from StackOverflow: default-src * data: blob: filesystem: about: ws: wss: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-dynamic' ; script-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' ; connect-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline' ; img-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline' ; frame-src * data: blob: ; style-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline' ; font-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline' ; frame-ancestors * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline' ; for 2sxc it can be shorted to: // all-src would always be applied to all rules all-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline' default-src filesystem: about: ws: wss: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-dynamic' script-src 'unsafe-eval' You can now start to tighten up the rules."

    "keywords": "Content Security Policy (CSP) Parts in 2sxc Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security policy that helps you to protect your web application from cross-site scripting attacks. This should give you an overview as to the parts that make CSP work in 2sxc with Dnn and Oqtane. 2sxc Implementation 2sxc uses the following parts to make it work Global Features which can be enabled/disabled CSP Settings at Site / Global level Settings at the App-Level which will be included automatically Policies for different user groups Automatic White-Listing of Trusted Resources C# / Razor APIs for advanced scenarios Special all-src shorthand Test configurations which can be activated during development Really Smart CSP Engine which combines everything to make the rules you need turnOn JavaScript to run scripts which need Razor data DNN Page Integration LightSpeed Integration Global CSP Features You can manage CSP features in the system administration to enable/disable just the rules you want. For example, you could only enable dev-rules until you are happy with the configuration. Note The CSP features are very advanced features. They are exclusive to patrons who support 2sxc. To use them, you must enable the bundle Patron Sentinel. Settings Global and Site Settings You can configure CSP settings at the site- and global-level. Anything that is configured at global, but not site-level, will use the global settings. With these settings you can: Enable/Disable CSP Determine if it's report-only or fully enforced Set a bunch of rules which will be applied Note that if you set CSP rules at the site level, they will apply to that site and not inherit global settings any more. This is by design, because it could lead to very confusing, hard-to-debug configurations. App Settings The same configuration which is applied to the site or global can also be configured at the app-level. The main difference is that this will only be applied to pages which have that App. In addition, these settigs will be mixed in with the site/global settings. Tip All default 2sxc Apps have been built with CSP in mind, so all of them already include the CSP settings they need. You may need to get the latest releases to see this in action. Content Security Policies by User Groups Different users typically need different CSP policies. For example, we can really harden the Content Security Policy for end-users, as we can clearly restrict what they need and can do. Admins and super-users cannot work with the most restrictive rules, because some of the admin-functionality needs more permissions. 2sxc has policies for these user groups: SystemAdmin - a policy which will only apply to system admins SiteAdmin - a policy which will only apply to site admins Anonymous - a policy which will only apply to anonymous users Default - the default policy which is used if no other policy is defined Dev - a policy which will only apply if the url has ?csp=dev Automatic White-Listing Trusted Resources As a developer, you want your code to just-work. So ideally any JS/CSS you add, is automatically white-listed. But we cannot just white-list every <script> tag in your code, as that would make CSP useless again. So to make this easy and secure, there are two ways to white-list your trusted resources. Tip All default 2sxc Apps apply these practices. You may need to get the latest releases to see this in action. Option 1: Registered Web-Resources Every registered web-resource used by your code will be white-listed automatically. Web Resources are registered in the Settings at global, site or app-level, and then activated using the Razor API. Kit.Page.Activate(\"fancybox4\", \"MySpecialFormJs\"); Option 2: Explicitly Whitelist Assets If you have inline scripts or styles, you can mark them as trusted by using the Razor API. <script src=\"@App.Path/@Edition/dist/scripts.min.js\" @pageSvc.AssetAttributes()></script> The AssetAttributes(...) will also do other things like set script priorities. But anywhere it's applied it will also mark it for whitelisting in CSP (if CSP is enabled). Tip The Asset-Attributes will add a secret nonce to the HTML. Internally it will be processed and removed again, but this ensures that the HTML can carry a single-use key to whitelist the resource, while making it impossible for an attacker to guess the key. C# APIs for Advanced Scenarios The previously mentioned features cover 99.9% of all use cases. We ourselves have not seen a scenario that would need more than this. But you may want to create other rules for your own use-cases. In this case, you can use the IPageService.AddCsp method. Special all-src Shorthand CSP is a funny beast. If you set a rule such as default-src: https: it will be be applied automatically for js, css, fonts etc. ...But only if you don't set those rules as well. As soon as you set script-src: 'self', it will not include the previous https: rule. I assume there are cases where this makes sense. But in our experience this leads to a lot of mistakes. For example, if the site already whitelists https: an an App also needs whitelist another font, it would have to also manually add all the previous rules. We felt this is not a good idea. So we've added a special all-src shorthand which will apply the rule to all resources. It works as follows: Everything you add to all-src is added to default-src Whenever other rules are added - such as font-src - it will add all the rules ever added to all-src as well Test Configurations for Development Testing and developing your CSP rules can be very tricky, especially on a live site. Because if the HTTP headers block something, the site may become unusable. There are three distinct challenges: Step-by-step tweaking your rules Improving your rules on a site which already has CSP Testing rules for different roles / user-groups ...and all this on a live site, without accidentally blocking the site for everyone. 2sxc makes this possible with a combination of 3 features: A global feature which enables this dev-mode A special Setting called Dev which is only used for development A url-parameter ?csp=true which will switch a page to use the Dev settings This way you can test modified rules in all kinds of combinations and with various users. Once you're happy, you can then copy/paste the configuration to the live Settings. Smart CSP Engine Technically the HTTP-header can only be set once. So to make it possible to merge rules / configurations from the Site, App and Razor code, we've implemented a Smart Engine. It will collect all the requirements and before rendering the final page, it merges everything to a final rule-set and generates the HTTP-Header. turnOn JavaScript 2sxc introduced turnOn in v12.04 in preparation for CSP. It is a crucial part in the entire concept, because it allows you to place your scripts in external files, and still use parameters/configuration from Razor (such as the ModuleId) in your scripts. Do check it out 😉. DNN Page Integration All of this leaves just one final piece of the puzzle: DNN Pages without 2sxc on it. We also want to protect these pages. Technically this requires the CSP Smart-Engine to be activate on the skin. We do this automatically, the moment you access DynamicCode using the IDynamicCodeService on the skin. To make it work, you must get DynamicCode of the Site or any App from the theme. The rest will happen automatically. Something like this will do the trick: <%-- This has all common 2sxc services and GetScopedService(...) --%> <%@ Import Namespace=\"ToSic.Sxc.Services\" %> <%-- This namespace provides IDynamicCode --%> <%@ Import Namespace=\"ToSic.Sxc.Code\" %> <script runat=\"server\"> // Get the Dynamic Code of this Site = OfSite() and keep for re-use protected IDynamicCode SiteDynCode { get { return _sdc ?? (_sdc = this.GetScopedService<IDynamicCodeService>().OfSite()); } } private IDynamicCode _sdc; </script> Note that your code must access the SiteDynCode somewhere so the OfSite() is actually run. LightSpeed Integration We've ensured that CSP will also work with LightSpeed Cache. So even cached modules and Apps will still apply the CSP rules.

    "keywords": "Content Security Policy (CSP) Whitelist Guide Most of your CSP policies will allow something to work. This is called whitelisting. Default fallback First, we set the all-src directive with the value 'self' and https:. This will force the browser to only accept sources originating from the host URL. all-src is a custom directive from 2sxc, which all source directives inherit from. all-src 'self' https: To improve documentation / clarity, you can also use multiple lines and comments: // Always allow things from the own server all-src: 'self' // No matter where it comes from, it must use HTTPS all-src: https: Script sources For JavaScript code, we use the scipt-src directive. It is important for this directive to have 'self' specified as origin, but because we have set the all-src directive it gets inherited automatically. For the trusted scripts to work properly we will also add 'unsafe-eval', which will allow script execution methods. script-src 'unsafe-eval' Style Sources Because we sometimes use inline styles, we need to add the directive style-src with the value 'unsafe-inline'. style-src 'unsafe-inline' Font Sources Some of our fonts are hosted on the same origin and some are external. Inline Fonts For example, we may allow fonts from inline data. You would do this by adding a font-src with the value data:. font-src data: Google Fonts Because fonts are often included in the skin, we can't whitelist them using 2sxc and must specify them in the config. For fonts included from google you typically need to add the url fonts.googleapis.com as trusted style-src origin and fonts.gstatic.com as trusted font-src origin. style-src https://fonts.googleapis.com font-src https://fonts.gstatic.com Image sources We will only allow images from secure sources. If you have the all-src specified above, we don't need to add this again. But we may wish to add data: for inline images. img-src data: Media sources For the usage of video/audio tags we will only allow media from secure sources as well. The \"media-src\" directive with the value \"'self' https:\" will be automatically assumed, if you have the all-src set above. Form actions Form actions can be a sensitive topic while handling data. Simply by adding the form-action directive with the value \"'self'\", we can prevent data-leaks. When dealing with other websites you should add the external domain specifically, like for example \"'self' https://externaldomain.com\". form-action 'self' form-action https://externaldomain.com Insecure (http) Resources For most resources we have specified to only allow secure https connections as origin. Because it would be hard to migrate every HTTP resource to HTTPS, we can use the \"upgrade-insecure-requests\" directive. Using this directive, the browser will request every resource (even if originating from HTTP) using HTTPS. Note that we don't recommend doing this! Include External Resources When including external resources in apps, you should use the AssetAttributes method from the IPageService. @inherits Custom.Hybrid.Razor14 <script src=\"@App.Path/dist/scripts.min.js\" @Kit.Page.AssetAttributes() ></script> For cases, which are outside of the scope of 2sxc Apps you can whitelist them by specifying the directive script-src with the origin URL. Trusted, Pre-Registered Web Resources For pre-registered resources, you can also just activate them. @inherits Custom.Hybrid.Razor14 @{ Kit.Page.Activate(\"turnOn\", \"2sxc.JsCore\", \"fancybox4\"); } Fontawesome Icon Libraries As our default icon library, fontawesome gets set as trusted source automatically by 2sxc. This will only work if added using Kit.Page.Activate(\"Fontawesome5\"). Otherwise you will have to specify it in the configuration. @inherits Custom.Hybrid.Razor14 @{ Kit.Page.Activate(\"fontawesome5\"); } FancyBox Within 2sxc the FancyBox library is also a pre-registered resource. Because 2sxc hosts the JavaScript file internally, we only need to trust the origin of its stylesheet file. We do this by adding a \"style-src\" directive and setting the \"cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fancyapps/\" origin as value. But this will also happen automatically when we activate the resource. @inherits Custom.Hybrid.Razor14 @{ Kit.Page.Activate(\"fancybox3\"); }"

It's recommended for giving DOM elements a unique id for scripts to then access them. It's generated for every content-block, and more reliable than Module.Id since that sometimes results in duplicate keys, if the many blocks are used inside each other. It's generated using a GUID and converted/shortened. In the current version it's 8 characters long, so it has 10^14 combinations, making collisions extremely unlikely. (currently 8 characters) Tip To get a unique key which is based on additional objects such as Entities, use the UniqueKeyWith(params object[]) method. Declaration public string UniqueKey { get; } Property Value Type Description string Remarks If you get a fresh IKeyService it will also create a new UniqueKey.

It provides all items of the current App or of another App if needed. How to use with the VisualQuery When using the VisualQuery you can just drag it into your query. In its initial state, the Default out stream will deliver all Entities of all Content-Types which you can then filter. 🔑 However, you can rename that or create more; the out-connections will automatically filter to the name of the matching content types, which looks like this: There are three common use cases: 1. Using App With The Current App You can either just use it without any In stream, then it will just deliver the published items. This is because without an In, the App will automatically build an In providing published only. If you do provide any kind of in, it will use that as the source. So if you provide a Publishing-Source on the in, which will cause the App DataSource to differ the result based on the user who is looking at it. So editors would see unpublished as well: 2. Using App with Other App The App-DataSource can also be configured to deliver data from another app. For this, to configure and set the ZoneId and AppId: You can also deliver data from different Apps by using multiple App sources: Programming With The App DataSource We recommend to use the VisualQuery where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript. It's also better because it separates data-retrieval from visualization. Important: to access data of the current App, please use the App.Data as it's a pre-build object with the same streams. For example, use App.Data[\"BlogPost\"] to get all the BlogPost items. An example code @{ var blog = CreateSource<ToSic.Eav.DataSources.App>(); blog.ZoneSwitch = 2; // go to Zone 2 blog.AppSwitch = 403; // go to App 403 } @foreach(var post in AsList(blog[\"BlogPost\"])) { <div>@post.EntityTitle</div> } The previous example creates an App source to the zone 2, app 403 and retrieves all items of type BlogPost to show in a loop. Important When Coding Note that data sources only retrieve data once, and then ignore any further configuration. So you must set Zone/App before accessing the data.

This is what it usually looks like: The above example shows two filters finding items and delivering them on the same stream. Because 1 item would have been delivered 2x (2sic is in Switzerland), the default-stream now only contains each item once, and the duplicates can also be retrieved from the Duplicates stream if needed.

It provides a lot of core functionality to get configurations, ensure caching and more. Important: in most cases you will inherit the CustomDataSource DataSource for custom data sources. The RelationshipFilter DataSource is part of the Standard EAV Data Sources. It will return only the items which have a relationship to another item - like books having an author, or blog-posts with the tag grunt. How to use with the VisualQuery When using the VisualQuery you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like: Using Url Parameters You can of course also use URL parameters for both the value as well as the field: Using the Fallback In case none of the items match the reqiurement, then either no items are returned, or those in the fallback stream: You can find more fallback examples like chaining them in the ValueFilter DataSource Separators for Multiple Criterias (2sxc 9.9+) Until 2sxc 9.8 you could only check for 1 related item, so you could only say \"give me all items which have this one author\". In 2sxc 9.9 we are now able to specify multiple authors, allowing queries like \"give me all items which have all these authors\" or \"give me all items which have any of these authors\". This works using the separation-character, which is usually a comma , but could be something different (in case your items have commas in the texts you're comparing). If you don't specify a separator, none will be used and the whole Filter criteria is treated as one value. Here's where you set it: All Operators (2sxc 9.9+) Untill 2sxc 9.8, you could not specify an operator, and contains was the assumed operator. In 9.9 we added a lot more. To explain what each does, assume that our main stream contains items of BlogPost and we only want to keep the posts having certain Tags. Here's the list, each is explained more below: contains - will return all items (BlogPosts), having all the children (tags) specified containsany - will return all items (BlogPosts) having any of the children (tags) specified not-contains will return all items (BlogPosts) not-having-all of the children (tags). So it will also return those items, having some of the children. not-containsany will return all items (BlogPosts) having none of the children (tags) specified. any will return all items (BlogPosts) having any children at all (tags). So the filter is ignored. This is the same as count=0. not-any will return all items (BlogPosts) having no children (tags). first will return all items (BlogPosts) where the first child (tag) is one of the filter-options. This is for scenarios where you say the first tag is a primary-category or similar. not-first will return all items (BlogPosts) where the first children (tags) is not one of the filter values. count will return all items (BlogPosts) having a specific amount of children (tags) not-count will return all items (BlogPosts) not having a specific amount of children (tags) Filtering On Fields other than Title and ID (9.9+) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to specify which field you want to compare (before it was always Id or Title). Here's an example: Filtering by Relationship-Count (9.9+) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to filter by amount of relationships - so you could say \"give me all blog-posts with exactly 2 tags\": Note: you can also reverse this, so instead of count you can use not-count to get all the items that don't match this requirement. Filtering by Has-Any (9.9+) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to filter by Limitations of the RelationshipFilter Note that as of now (2sxc 9.9) the RelationshipFilter: can only seek child-items Programming With The RelationshipFilter DataSource We recommend to use the VisualQuery where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript.

    "keywords": "Class Sql Provide Entities from a SQL Server The SqlDataSource DataSource is part of the Standard EAV Data Sources. It lets you use data from SQL databases as if they were entities. How to use with the VisualQuery When using the VisualQuery you can just drag it into your query. The Default out will contain the items from the DB: We recommend that you rename it so you know what it's for: You can then configure your connection to the DB and Query as you need it: Understanding the Settings Title & Notes This is just for your notes, to remind you what this is for and to put notes about anything you wanted to remember. Connection There are two ways to connect to SQL databases: using a Connection Name (which points to a detailed connection string in the web.config) or using a detailed Connection String as you need it. We recommend to use connection names where possible. If you provide both, the connection name will be used: The SQL-Query The Query section has quite a lot of options, most of which are not required but are important for this to work: Here's what you need to know Content Type all entities must have a type-name - so you can just enter something here - in most cases the exact name isn't important, because you usually don't refer back to this, unless further processing will try to filter this or something EntityId and EntityTitle when using entities in 2sxc / EAV, each entity must be able to supply a title and an ID which is an integer. This is important for internal data processing to work. For this to work with SQL, the source needs to know what data-fields to use for this. By default it will use a field called EntityId and EntityTitle, but you can also use any other field - in which case you must supply the names in the following fields. Using URL Parameters in Queries The SQL DataSource can also use queries which use URL Parameters. It's safe and automatically prevent SQL Injection. For example, you can do the following: SELECT TOP (1000) PortalId as EntityId, HomeDirectory as EntityTitle,PortalID,ExpiryDate, AdministratorRoleId,GUID,HomeDirectory, CreatedOnDate,PortalGroupID FROM [Portals] Where PortalId = [QueryString:Id] This will automatically use the id parameter from the URL to filter the result. Using Another Entity As SQL Parameter You can of course use the In stream to provide entities which configure the SQL. The following example has a content-type SqlSetting with only one item (to make the example easier to understand). The App DataSource delivers this in the AppSetting stream, which also goes into the Sql as AppSetting and is then used as a token in the SQL: Using A Value from a Module-Instance as SQL Parameter This works like in the App-example: Provide the data from the ModuleDataSource as an In stream to the SqlDataSource, and use that to filter: Programming With The SqlDataSource DataSource We recommend to use the VisualQuery where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript. It's also better because it separates data-retrieval from visualization. An example code @{ var sql = CreateSource<ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Sql>(); sql.ConnectionString = \"SiteSqlServer\"; // use Dnn sql.SelectCommand = \"Select ... From\"; // your sql here } @foreach(var post in AsList(sql[\"Default\"])) { <div>@post.EntityTitle</div> } Important When Coding Note that data sources only retrieve data once, and then ignore any further configuration. So you must set everything before accessing the data.

It provides a lot of core functionality to get configurations, ensure caching and more. Important: in most cases you will inherit the CustomDataSource DataSource for custom data sources. The ValueFilter DataSource is part of the Standard EAV Data Sources. It will filter items based on the values - and if none are found, will optionally return a fallback-list. How to use with the VisualQuery When using the VisualQuery you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like: The above example shows that 2 of the 5 items fulfilled the filters requirements. Using Url Parameter for Filtering You can also filter using values from the URL, like this: Using Multiple URL Parameters ...and of course you can also use url parameters to specify field-names and value: ... or field, value and operator: Comparison Operators There are many operators possible - see the in-UI help bubble for that. Using Fallback Streams The filter will return the items which match the requirement, but sometimes none will match. This is common when you have a parameter from the Url, which may not match anything. In the simple version this looks like this: ...this previous example used a filter criteria which didn't match any items, so it resulted in delivering all. This is very useful when you want to cascade optional filters, like this: ...this example shows two filters - the first didn't match anything (it was blank), so it delivered all items, the second one then worked, and reduced the remaining items to 2.

It provides a lot of core functionality to get configurations, ensure caching and more. Important: in most cases you will inherit the CustomDataSource DataSource for custom data sources. The ValueSort DataSource is part of the Standard EAV Data Sources. It will reorder items passing through A-Z or Z-A based on a value of each item. How to use with the VisualQuery When using the VisualQuery you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like: The above example shows the same items being sorted in two different ways and delivered to the target. Example Using Multi-Sort You can also sort multiple fields, so \"first sort by xyz, then by xyz\" and use different sort-orders.: Example Using URL Parameters ...and of course you can also use url parameters to specify field-names or sort order: Sorting Direction For sorting direction you can use either words or numbers asc/desc 1/0 Programming With The ValueSort DataSource We recommend to use the VisualQuery where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript.

    "keywords": "Namespace ToSic.Lib.Logging The EAV system has a powerful internal logging system. It's the backbone to Insights. This is where it resides - usually you don't want to know about it ;). If you do, here a short conceptual background: Any object can have a property - usually called Log which is an ILog . Using this the object can call the Log.Add(...) to add messages. Many other commands help in various scenarios. The real power comes from chaining these - because each logger can know what parent-logger it reports to. This allows us to reproduce the chain of events in the original code, because you can track where loggers were made, and how they relate. The really amazing bit is that the logger will also pick up the class names, code-file names and line of code where it was logged 😎. Most objects which use the Log, implement the IHasLog, often by inheriting ToSic.Lib.Logging.HasLog which automates things when initializing - like the chaining of the Loggers. Classes CodeRef Reference to source code. It contains the path to the file, the method name and the line in the code. This is used to track the exact location in the code where a log was added/created. IHasLogExtensions Extension to objects having a Log, to connect them to parent logs. ILogCallExtensions Extensions for ILogCall objects which don't need to return a value. ILogExtensions Various extensions for ILog objects to add logs. They are all implemented as extension methods, so that they will not fail even if the log object is null. ILog_Actions Extension methods for Actions (functions which don't return a value). ILog_Add Various extensions for ILog objects to add logs. They are all implemented as extension methods, so that they will not fail even if the log object is null. ILog_Properties Extension methods for property getters and setters. LogConstants Interfaces ICanDebug Trivial interface just to ensure that we have debug on/off consistent ICanDump Interface to mark classes which can dump their state into the log as a string. IHasLog Objects which can log their activity, and share their log with other objects in the chain to produce extensive internal logging. ILog A logger with special capabilities. It can take log messages, and chain itself to other loggers. If chained, it can broadcast the messages to the other loggers from that time forward. Basically this is the backbone of Insights. To add messages/logs of all kinds you must use null-safe extension methods. It will require you to add the namespace ToSic.Lib.Logging. ILogCall A log object used to log the activity of a specific function call. It is usually created in the beginning of the call and closed on various return calls or at the end of the function. Note that most of the methods used to complete a call are extension methods. ILogCall<T> A mini logger for a function call, which should be closed using a form of Return(...) when the function completes. ILogStore Interface to add ILogs to the log storage."

Interfaces ICanBeItem This is just a helper interface. Reason is that we have different types of objects representing real entity-data such as: IDynamicEntity ITypedItem To make sure that APIs which use this have a consistent structure, these objects all implement this interface. IContextData The main data source for Blocks (Razor, WebApi). Internally often uses CmsBlock to find what it should provide. It's based on the PassThrough data source, because it's just a wrapper. IDynamicEntity This is a wrapper for IEntity objects. It provides nicer access to underlying properties and automatically handles things like multi-language etc. The underlying IEntity IEntity is in the Entity property. Normally you will use it without caring about these internals. Please check @HowTo.DynamicCode.DynamicEntity IDynamicStack This is a dynamic object which contains multiple dynamic objects (Sources). It will try to find a value inside each source in the order the Sources are managed. IField This describes a field-property of an item/entity. It's used for APIs which can need to know more about the field holding an item, like: The field name and parent reference The values in raw and converted Any metadata of the field IMetadata Metadata on Dynamic Objects - like IDynamicEntity or IAsset (files/folders). Behaves like a normal DynamicEntity, but has additional commands to detect if specific Metadata exists. ISecureData<T> This object contains decrypted data (if it was encrypted originally) and tells you if the data was encrypted, signed etc. It's still very basic, and will grow in functionality to assist in handling secure / encrypted / signed data. ITyped This describes objects which usually wrap other objects to provide strictly typed access to properties. have typed Methods to read properties like .String(propName). It's usually the result of a AsTyped(something) or AsItem(...) command. It's meant to help Razor etc. access unknown or dynamic objects in a typed way. ITypedItem A typed object to access data.

But the Razor compiler cannot know that it got a list, so using .Any() or similar fails. To fix this, put an AsList around it - a bit like AsList(myThing.Tags). Sometimes you'll also need to help a bit more with AsList(myThings.Tags as object). Now you can do things like var tags = AsList(myThings.Tags as object); if (myTags.Any()) {...} Read more about this in the Dnn LINQ Tutorials | Improve this Doc View Source AnyDateTimeProperty A Dynamic Entity always contains an item of your data - a book, person, blog-post or a piece of content.

It will look up the configuration in the CMS (like the Module-Settings in DNN) to determine what data is needed for the block. Usually it will then find a reference to a ContentBlock, from which it determines what content-items are assigned. It could also find that the template specifies a query, in which case it would retrieve that. Was previously called ModuleDataSource CmsBlock DataSource (Module-Data) The CmsBlock DataSource DataSource is part of the Standard 2sxc/Dnn Data Sources. It is the default data source as it directly delivers module-instance data and is used for all scenarios which don't explicitly have a query, and it can also be used as part of a query. How to use with the VisualQuery When using the VisualQuery it is already in the default / initial query: The above example shows: all data start in the cache ICache it is then by default passed through the PublishingFilter then it enters this Instance/Module, which gets the current ModuleInstance and passes on the data which has been assigned to it Using Module/Instance Data For Configuration Things get really exciting when you use values which the user edited in the module as a setting in your query. Here's an example: As you can see, the Default out of the CmsBlock is passed into the ValueSort data source with the stream-name Settings and is then used in a token to configure bbehavior of the sort. Manually Assigning a Module ID (2sxc 9.9) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the configuration dialog, so you can specify what module the data should come from. This allows you to have configuration-modules or primary-data-modules, which are re-used in queries: Programming With The CmsBlock DataSource We recommend to use the VisualQuery where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript. It's also better because it separates data-retrieval from visualization. The only property you need to set is InstanceId (2sxc 9.9+) if you want to provide a different module-id.

Tip You may sometimes find old code which does something like data.on(...) or data.sourceUrl - this is obsolete and will not work any more. 👉 Check out the Js Data and Query Tutorials Tip The data format is described here: JSON Data Format used in WebAPI calls (technical) Get a Data Service Get the Sxc Instance of the current module Call .data(contentTypeName) to get the service Example: const modId = @CmsContext.Module.Id; const sxc = $2sxc(modId); const authorsSvc = sxc.data('Authors'); authorsSvc.getAll().then(authors => console.log(authors)); Data Service Factory Parameters The data(...) factory just has one parameter: the contentTypeName. The returned service will always perform actions for this content-type. Data Service APIs Data Services always return a modern Promise containing data.

Each of these has the following parameters url or settings required string|object: a Url for the end-point OR a { ... } settings object params optional object: the url params like { id: 27, name: \"hello\" } data optional object: the data - in case of post / put, like { ... } preventAutoFail optional bool: if true, won't automatically show a default message on error, so that you can handle errors differently Quick examples: var sxc = $2sxc(27); sxc.webApi.post(\"Form/ProcessForm\", {}, data, true) .success(function() { // .... }) .error(function() { // ... }); This will call the C# WebApi controller FormController in the api folder and go for its ProcessForm command. It will use no url-params, but put a data object in the body (as json), and will do error-handling itself. In short: use $2sxc(...).webApi.get(...) or $2sxc(...).webApi.post(...) etc. for the path-parameter, use a path starting with app/auto/query/[queryname] - 2sxc will take care of all the path resolutions if the path starts with app/auto/query/ Working with Custom C# App WebAPIs In short: use $2sxc(...).webApi.get(...) or $2sxc(...).webApi.post(...) etc. for the path-parameter, use a path starting with app/auto/api/[controller]/[action] - 2sxc will take care of all the path resolutions if the path starts with app/auto/api/ You can read more about the C# WebApi Server Side Short note: the WebAPIs work like classic javascript promises. So not like the data.on(event) implementation which is a bit special, this is very standard jQuery promise. Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App TimeLineJS all the JS-apps including AngularJS in the app-catalog More links: Description of the feature on 2sxc docs Declaration function request(settings: string | ZzzAjaxSettingsDeprecated, params: any, data: any, preventAutoFail: boolean, method: string) Parameters Type Name Description string | ZzzAjaxSettingsDeprecated settings any params jQuery style ajax parameters any data jQuery style data for post/put requests boolean preventAutoFail string method the http verb name Returns Type Description any jQuery ajax promise object"

Special Behavior of The Content App When adding the Content-App to a page, the dialog which appears will ask the editor to choose the Content-Type (like Image) and then how to show it (like Full-Size). This is different from all other Apps where the editor will first choose the App (like Blog), and then the functionality (like Tag-Cloud). The Content App is quickly added as another module: It will first show the Content Type picker: ...and then the View to use for this Content-Type. Pre-Built Content Templates The Content App can auto-install prepared templates which are specifically designed for this use case. This is why the installer looks different for The Content App than for normal Apps.

Apps can be really trivial. For example they may only contain 1 simple Hello World template and no data at all. And they may also contain 100'000 data items and complex list/details templates. Apps are Installed per Site The EAV is multi-site capable and each Site in the platform corresponds to a Zone in the EAV. A Site corresponds to a Portal in Dnn or a Site in Oqtane. Each Zone contains at least 1 default app called Content and additional Apps as configured. Note The ZoneId is usually different than the Dnn PortalId or the Oqtane SiteId, so Dnn has a PortalSetting to connect this and Oqtane has a matching Setting. Tip Apps are installed per Site. So if your platform has multiple Sites, then each site can have different apps, or the same app may be installed multiple times. Types of Apps Your App can be anything you want it to be. The following types are more to give you a sense of how Apps can be used, but these types are not clearly defined. An App can also be many of these at the same time. Data Focused Apps This is the kind of App a developer usually thinks of - with lots of data and various list/details templates. The core idea of these apps is that the data is one or many shared tables and the output will show parts of this data based on rules, filters etc. Examples of such Apps would be: News Blog References FAQ Custom Forms Apps Content Focused Apps / Site Builder Apps This is the kind of App an editor usually thinks of. The core ideas is that the editor adds an App to a page, and adds data to that instance. The data belongs to that instance, so even if it's technically in a shared table, the user experience makes it feel like each use is autonomous. Examples of such Apps would be: The Content App Image Sliders / Swipers Galleries Image Hotspots Accordions QR Code Page Enhancing Apps This is an App which does something on every page of the Site. The core idea is that a functionality can be used on every page and the logic and data to ensure this is in the App. This kind of App is usually added to the Skin/Theme of the Site so it's available on all pages by default. Examples of such Apps would be: Add Script or CSS Snippets to a page SEO or Open-Graph Enhancements on each page Page protection systems where a part of the page is overlayed until people subscribe Adding third-party extensions such as Disqus, AddSearch or Google Search/Analytics to a page SPA Apps (Single Page Applications) This is an App which contains a JavaScript SPA which will then be the entire UI for users. The data is usually accessed using either the Headless API or custom C# WebAPIs which are also part of the App. Examples of such Apps would be: Customer management SPA A complex search/filter SPA You can create such SPAs using any popular JavaScript Framework such as Angular React Vue The Content App 👉 See The Content App The Primary App 👉 See The Primary App You may want to learn more about The App Folder Structure App Icons Bundling / Optimizing assets"

Important This only works if the feature has been enabled and requires the EnterpriseCMS license - docs WIP! How it Works TODO: Inherited Apps work like a multi-layer app. The bottom layer is the Ancestor App. Changes to this affect all Apps which inherit it. On top of this is the Descendant App on a specific site, it can only add more material to the parent app, but not change any inherited data Descendant Apps inherit all this: App Name and Folder Name (they must be the same) All Content-Types of the Ancestor All Data / Entities of the Ancestor All Queries of the Ancestor All View definitions of the Ancestor All Template files and JS/CSS resources in the global storage of the App Descendant Apps don't inherit this: Settings - not sure yet if they do - still WIP Templates and Resources in the local storage of the Ancestor App ADAM files of the Ancestor App How to Create Enable Feature Define the Ancestor / Master App Define an Descendant App Test :) Best Practices Everything in the ancestor App will be available in all inherited apps, and anything you change can affect the inherited Apps. Because of this, you should not use an App from a productive site (like the main/home site) as an ancestor, but always create a special site which isn't public, just to manage the ancestors. This will save you a lot of pains which would result from quickly making some edits which accidentally affect all the child sites. Enable the Feature TODO: Migrate an Existing App to becoming a Master Ancestor Create the Ancestor App TODO: todo Limitations of the Ancestor App You must be aware of a few limitations in the Ancestor App. Only views with templates stored in the global location can be used in Descendant Apps If you have data (entities) with images/files in the data, they cannot use the file:72 reference, but must use the full path to the file for it to work on other sites, as the file-id lookup would not work in other sites.

Re-Using Templates Note Re-Using in many Views Sometimes you'll want to use the same template file in multiple Views. This can just be configured at the View level Tip Re-Using Templates Across Portals Instead of placing the template in the App-folder of the current portal, you can also place it in a global App-folder in the _default portal of Dnn. This is great if you have the same app in many portals, and want to centralize the template. Tip Razor Templates also support re-using template parts or any C# code. You can also pass parameters to these parts, which allows you to share template-code across templates.

How it Works Views configure what templates are combined with what Content-Type to then produce an output. Read more about Templates here The template-file is just part of the view. To be used as a view, it must be configured in the App configuration as a view, where you add things like Name or Thumbnail Image (for the preview when selecting the view) Data specs like what type of data is shown, if the data comes from a query etc. View Parameters to automatically show this view based on url-parameters Tip Views can also specify more Content-Types for using in the Header or Presentation. In addition, they could also say that the data comes from a Query instead of from user/editor input. View Configuration 👉 See View Configuration View Identifier 2sxc 12.02 introduces a the Identifier. This is useful in scenarios where the same Template is used in multiple views, and should result in slightly different output in each case. The Identifier let's you specify a key to differentiate which behavior the template should have. For example: Two views are configured, one with the name 2 Columns has an Identifier 2Col the other called 3 Columns has 3Col. Your razor code can then access this on CmsContext.View.Identifier and change what CSS classes it uses. In theory you could also check the Name property on CmsContext.View.Name but that could change based on the language, which is why you should use the Identifier. In more complex scenarios we suggest you use View Settings. View Settings 👉 See View Settings (Advanced ⚠) View Resources 👉 See View Resources (Advanced ⚠) View Polymorphism Polymorphism can be activated on views (new in v11). When you do this, you can choose between two modes Permission based: in this case SuperUsers get the template from the staging folder while public users get the template from live or the primary one which was configured in the View configuration CSS framework based: here the view will automatically try to pick the file from the folder matching the CSS framework set by the Theme/Skin Advanced Topics Switching between views based on the url Differences between features when using Content or App Protecting Views for certain users using permissions Hide advanced features from normal editors Razor Tutorial History Introduced in 2sxc 1.0 Automatic View-Polymorphism added in 2sxc 11 View Identifier added in 2sxc 12.02 View Settings added in 2sxc 12.02 View Resources added in 2sxc 12.02"

Why Use View Resources? If Views need multi-language texts or images then the Resources would be the right place to handle them. Examples button-labels Views whichs how tables may have a lot of row or column labels Tip View Resources complement App Resources. The difference is that App-Resources are available on all Templates while View-Resources are only available on the Views they are configured on. Tip If you can use View-Resources on multiple views. This is great in cases where the same template is used for multiple views. But you can also choose to use different Resources - just how you need it. Tip Remember that each Entity/Item can also be multi-language, so you only need View-Resources for static-localization. This means texts/labels/images which are the same every time the View is used. How do View Resources Work? View Resources are standard Entities in 2sxc. So you'll have to create a Content-Type for this containing the fields which you want to configure.

The user shouldn't have to worry about saving it in the right place. Ideally it's only used there, and when the content becomes obsolete, so do the assets that belong to it. Tip This is what ADAM is all about. It allows editors to just add images and files. ADAM will take these and magically store it somewhere so the user doesn't have to worry about folders and naming. Warning Since ADAM does everything behind the scenes, it's recommended that users don't try to link to files of another content-item, because that would defeat the purpose. It would also not allow any clean-up in future, because you wouldn't know if the asset was re-used. How ADAM works Internally ADAM creates a folder for each Entity (Content-Item) using the GUID of that item. It also creates a sub-folder for each field, so that a logo.png used in the Logo-field is separate from a my-case-study.pdf used in the CaseStudy-field. The final folder structure looks like this [Content-Root]/adam/[App-Folder-Name]/[Compact-Entity-Guid]/[Field-Name]/ How to Use ADAM is a standard part of 2sxc, it's automatically in use everywhere. Any link/file or wysiwyg field support drag-and-drop and will automatically store the file in the right place. Security Concerns ADAM uses the Dnn file-numbering system by default, and keeps a reference to file:27 in the field linking such a file. In rare situations you may have many untrusted editors, where you want to prevent them asking the API for file:1, file:2, file:3 etc. There is an advanced switch to only allow resolving the file number if it's really part of the current item.

What Dnn References to Portal to ZoneId Mapping The EAV has a virtual container called a Zone which is similar to a Portal in Dnn. The IDs will not match though, so each Portal has a setting called ToSIC_SexyContent_ZoneID which contains the ZoneId for that portal. When 2sxc is used the first time on a portal, it will detect a missing ZoneId, which triggers zone creation and sets this value. Module-Installation to App-Installation Mapping A Dnn Module installation corresponds to an App installation. Internally there is no mapping, as it is not necessary. There is an important difference though: in Dnn, each installed Module is installed at the System level, so installed Modules are available on all Portals. On the other hand, Apps are installed at the Zone (Portal) level, so each app is only available on that portal. Customizations to the app also only affect that portal, and each Portal could have the same App installed in different versions. Note Technically there are a few ways to share Apps, their data, templates etc. across Portals, but these are fairly advanced scenarios. Module-On-Page to ContentBlock Mapping In Dnn each modules has Module Settings to store configuration. 2sxc stores these two pieces of information in the Module Settings: App ID - what app is being shown here Content Block ID - the GUID of the Content Block Entity containing the rest of the configuration Understanding how this ties in helps you make better decisions. Make sure you also read Content - Data made Useful Basic Setup: Content is assigned to the module This is the most common setup - and used in the Content module as well as in many App modules, which rely on the author to manually create content for this specific module. It's not usually used in data-oriented modules like news, blogs, etc. Here is how it's mapped: Also Read about Content Data Model Best also read about Content - Data made Useful in general.

The data model for these Content Blocks looks like this: So each Content Block has: One reference to a View configuration Zero, one or many references to content items The same amount of Content-Presentation items Zero or one references to Header items The same amount of Header-Presentation items Tip Content Blocks contain a reference to the View and optionally a bunch of Content Items that will be used/shown in that View. But there are actually 4 possible scenarios deciding what is actually shown: The View can show the content-items provided by the Content Block The View can be configured to use a Query and show data from that The Template code could also get data from the App directly and show that Combinations of the three options above are possible Important Since the View can also be configured to get data from other sources, it may show items that are not in the list of the Content Block. Content Blocks in a CMS like Dnn When you see 2sxc data in Dnn, that's because a module was added to the page pointing to a Content Block. If you want to know more about that, read 2sxc Content in Dnn. Manually Managing this Data Note: you shoudn't usually do this - but sometimes you have to. Check out this short explanation: Note This scerenshot above is from 2sxc 8. In 2sxc 11 you can change scopes in the dropdown below the data table. FAQ If a page or module is deleted, does it also delete the Content Block? No. Note that if a page or module is deleted, it goes into the Dnn trash, so it could always be restored again. If a page or module is deleted from the trash, does it also delete the Content Block? No. Dnn does not inform modules about delete actions, so we can't do clean-up. Are Content Blocks which don't appear on a page orphaned and can I delete them? Maybe. Since they could be used in other apps (see Content - Data made Useful) as Inner Content, there is no quick way to tell if it's being used elsewhere. Can a Content Block be used on multiple modules / pages? Yes. It's not common, but since a module can be shown on multiple pages or even on other portals, it would show the same Content Block there as well."

    "keywords": "Inner Content (Content Within Other Content) Inner Content is the feature to place content-blocks (apps or common content-items) inside another content-item. There are two common scenarios for this: Apps with list/details views, with a feature rich details-view. For example: a blog, which lets the editor add galleries and other apps into each blog-post. This is called a mashup app as it mixes apps together Apps which wrap other content/apps, for example an accordion-app which lets the editor add further content-blocks or apps into each collapsing segment. Basic Concept Inner Content links other content-blocks (apps, content) to a Content Item, allowing the template to then show this inner content where it wants to. An Item can have Many Sets of Inner-Content A template can have multiple sets of inner content. For example: a real-estate app showing a details-page with 2 columns, each containing an variety of content-items, different from house-item to house-item. One house could have a gallery-app in the first column, while the other house would have a 3D walkthrough app and preferr to use the gallery in the second column a Catalog app containing many WYSIWYG text blocks (ProductDescription, ShowCase, ApplicationSuggestions) shown in multiple tabs, each WYSIWYG containing apps inline between the paragraphs. To achieve this flexibility, the Inner Content items are linked not only to a Content Item but to a specific field in that item. So each set of related items is stored in one field, and by using multiple fields you can have multiple sets of items. This allows the template to handle each set separately. Standalone Inner-Content - like a Dnn Pane just for this item A common use case is to provide the editor with an area into which he/she can add as many content-blocks/apps as they want to. This feels like a Dnn-pane - the editor just adds apps as he needs them. This mode is common for mashup-apps and is mostly used on sophisticated details-pages with a clear area containing additional functionality. It's also common in layout-changing apps like the accordion app. In WYSIWYG Inner-Content this is new in 2sxc 8.9 Sometimes you may let the editor add inner-content blocks within a wysiwyg-field, so that normal written content can be interspersed with apps. This is common in news-style apps or blogs, where additional features are needed (galleries, code-snippets, etc.) but mixed with the main text and not in a separate area. Here is a blog tutorial on implementing Very Rich Text. The Parts that Make it Work For Inner Content to work, the following parts play together: Data storage: you need fields in your content-type to link to the external content blocks. Just create entity-fields and use the type Content Block Items. In many cases you also want to hide the field because it's not important to the content-editor. Just go to the field-settings and set Visible in Edit UI to off. Content-Block rendering in the templates, using the Razor API - it is prepared both for the standalone-area-mode as well as the merge-with-wysiwyg-mode. In-Page Editing: to allow the editor to add / edit content-blocks in the normal view, the UI must support it. This is handeled automatically by Quick-Edit. To do the in-page Editing, quickE needs to know some context information (what field to store the links in, etc.), provided in an HTML-attribute. It's either rendered in automatically when using the Razor commands or you can manually place them using [context attributes](xref:Razor.ContextAttributes]. If you want the WYSIWYG-integration the wysiwyg must know which field to use to manage the linked content-blocks. This is simply done by convention: as soon as a content-block field follows right after a wysiwyg-field, they will be linked and the button will appear. This also works it the content-block field is set to invisible.

    "title": "Dnn/Evoq Page Versioning / Publishing and Workflow | 2sxc 16 / EAV 16",
    "keywords": "Dnn/Evoq Page Versioning / Publishing and Workflow This page explains how a Dnn / Evoq does page versioning and workflow, and how to leverage this with 2sxc. Background: Dnn / Evoq Page/Module Versioning Dnn / Evoq had a few different ways of doing versioning, but since Dnn 7.4.2 it basically uses a model which works as follows: Each page has a live version number (for this demo we'll say version P27 - for page 27). On this page, various modules exist, each having their own version number. Let's say we have a gallery-module which is currently on version 6 (MG6) and a module with a form in version 12 (MF12). So the page information currently has: P27 live Module 1: MG6 live Module 2: MF12 live Basic Example with Adding Module If a new module with a form is added in between, Dnn will do the following P28 draft (P27 is still live) Mod 1: MG6 live (same version on live and draft) Mod 2: MF1 new, regarded as draft Mod 3: MF13 draft (the position has changed, so the module info has changed) As further changes to modules additions / removals / reordering happen, this happens on the P28 version only. So even if we delete or rename a module, the live version will not show this. So Dnn mechanims incl. moving/renaming of modules is a Dnn/Evoq responsiblity, and is versioned by Dnn/Evoq. We'll talk about the internal content of a module further down. Publishing a Page Basically when an editor publishes a page, Dnn will do the following: set P28 to the published page tell each module to publish in that version (in case the module support inner versioning - read on...) Dnn / Evoq Workflows Because these topics are almost undocumented - and exist in different implementations, they are confusing. You need to know the following about workflows: Workflows apply to the page only, so pages need to know if they have a workflow and which one Modules don't know about these workflows... ...because Modules only get notified when the workflow reaches a \"publish\" state Background: Module Inside/Inner Versioning Modules have their own content which may or may not be versioned. 99% of all modules don't version their content and have no history. And 99.9% don't support Dnn/Evoq page versions & publishing. So IF a module doesn't know about these mechanisms, then changes inside that module will not be versioned and they will be live immediately as they are applied. But let's assume our modules do support this, and let's say the gallery with module-info in V6 (it was moved a few times, so it has 6 versions) still has the initial V1 content, which we'll call MGi1 (Module Gallery inside V1). Module Version Tree with Inner Version So let's look at the versioning tree as it really is P27 live Mod 1: MG6 live with MGi1 Mod 2: MF12 live with MFi26 (had made configuration changes, each versioned) Now let's simulate a change... Inner Content Changes Let's say the editor makes a small change to the Form-module. This will notify Dnn of a change. As this happens, it must tell Dnn that it has a new version - like this, so Dnn will also place the page in a new version (for later publishing): P28 draft Mod 1: MG6 live with MGi1 live Mod 2: MF12 live with MFi27 draft Note that if the form module makes more changes, it can choose to report this or not, since basically the newest version is a draft already, on a draft-page. Inner Content Publishing Now once the user decides to publish this page, each module (incl. the Forms-Module) will be notified to publish it's version. Dnn will tell the form which version it should publish (in this case v27). The form must take care of whatever processing to ensure that this version is now live / public. 2sxc Support for Dnn / Evoq Publishing 2sxc support the core parts of Dnn/Evoq Publishing and versioning. To be more specific, it will detect if the page requires a publishing workflow tell Dnn/Evoq that on-page content was edited modify the GUI to only allow draft/publish options as it corresponds with the page information listen to Dnn/Evoq messages to publish on-page information This sounds simple, but it's very complex because 2sxc can be used in many scenarios, and in some it's not always clear when to draft or publish something. So there are some exceptions, which are documented below. Activating Page Publishing Feature on 2sxc You don't have to do anything - 2sxc asks the environment (Dnn/Evoq) it it expects any publishing steps, and will automatically adjust its behavoir. Making Changes Start a Dnn-Page Versioning This too happens automatically, if the page has a publishing setup in Dnn/Evoq. Auto-Draft and Auto-Publish explained To be sure you understand what's going on, please note the following: Only changes which directly relate to a page cause auto-draft / auto-publish Example 1: A user changes a blog post on a blog-page. The page will get a new draft version and the live blog will show the old one, while the draft will show the new one. When the page is published, the draft will become live. Changes to content-items which are not directly tied to a page, will not cause drafting / publishing Example 2: When the user edits the blog post he also creates another category (which is used as data and not as on-page content). This category is immediately live, but will probably not show up as it's only used in the edited blog-post. Example 3: An admin-user goes into the admin UI and creates a blog post from within the admin-UI. It will not auto-default to draft, as this is not specific to any page. But if the user manually sets it to draft, it will be published when a page showing it is released. Restoring Previous Versions Dnn / Evoq has a mechanism for restoring previous page versions, and when implemented perfectly, all modules inside it could also revert back to the state it was in at that time. Such a perfect world is hard to implement and nearly impossible in a dynamic-content setup. For example, apps may have been deleted or content-types (schemas) may have changed. So the idea sounds good, but is impossible to implement correctly. So 2sxc goes the pragmatic way: You can restore any item to a previous version - so you can always roll back a blog-post to a previous copy, but putting the page back into an old version will not roll back anything inside a 2sxc-module. To Restore previous versions of content-items, use the history (clock) icon in the toolbar. Technical Deep Dive - Behind the Scenes In case you run into trouble or need to know more about the mechanisms, here's what you need to know What is an On-Page Change and What is Not By definition, any item created or modified directly from a toolbar button in the front end is regarded as an On-Page change and will start the page-draft process. This is basically all the buttons which normal (non-admin) users see. If you haven't heard of hiding admin-buttons, please read the concept on hiding advanced features. Specifically, this includes the following actions: editing content directly from a toolbar button adding new content to the page from a toolbar button moving items up/down in a content-item list using a toolbar button replacing an item on a page using the toolbar button The following actions are not regarded as on-page changes, and don't auto-force drafting: editing any data from the Admin-UI editing app-resources or app-settings creating / modifying views importing data / importing apps What is Published on Page-Publish and What Not When a page is published, Dnn/Evoq will tell each module that it should now publish that specific version assigned to that page version. When this happens, 2sxc does the following: Retrieves the (usually invisible/secret) content-group entity which contains the information, what template and what items are shown on this module. This one is probably stored as a draft from previous changes, as this one keeps track of the items to show and the order to show them in. This draft is then published. Reviews all items on the four primary in-streams, checks each entity and publishes draft versions. The streams it will process are: Default (this is the one provided on Content) Presentation ListContent (the header-content item) ListPresentation (the header presentation item) Note that other streams are not auto-published. This is to prevent side-effects. For example, a Blog-View could have additional streams to visualize authors, categories etc. but these will not be auto-published, as it is assumed that these are helper-data and not specifically on-page data for this page. Publishing Additional Items If you want to auto-publish additional items, just add them to a stream PartOfPage. Inner Content Handling (Very Rich Content) Inner Content is not currently treated as belonging to the page, as it is inside content which is already drafted/published. So inner-content is always published when created. Note that this is not fully tested/implemented, you may have unexpected consequences when working with inner content. Image And Asset Handling Images and assets are not versioned / published, as Dnn provides no effective way to enable this. So as of now, the following will happen: if a content-type has a file-field using ADAM with a single file (not library), then draging in an additional file will behave like the publishing, because the new file has a new number, and this is not in use till the item is published if the user drags in an updated file with the same name, it will internally receive a number at the end, and also stay unpublished, as it's a different file on the server if a user manually replaces a file (not drag-drop in ADAM) or deletes a file and then uploads the file with the same name, then this file is live, as it really changed the file on the server if you are using a library-field in ADAM (often used in galleries), then these files are automatically live as well, and deleted files are also removed immediately In case you are using an ADAM library and would like to only show the files which existed before you created an unpublished draft, this can be done in your template. Just remember that certain changes (like file-changes on the server) could change the modified date, and that deleting files also really removes live files as well. Here's how you can change your Razor: @* before, showing all files *@ @foreach(var pic in AsAdam(Content, \"Files\").Files) { <span>@pic.FileName, @pic.LastModificationTime</span><br> } @* only showing \"older\" files *@ @foreach(var pic in ((IEnumerable<ToSic.SexyContent.Adam.AdamFile>)AsAdam(Content, \"Files\").Files).Where(f => f.LastModificationTime <= Content.Modified)) { <span>@pic.FileName, @pic.LastModificationTime</span><br> } Notes and Clarifications As mentioned, this is the default setup. In the case of data-oriented apps, which query data from somewhere, you may have other expectations. At the moment there is no additional mechanism to customize this any further, but we believe that you can easily cover all possible scenarios with this setup.

To do this, you can choose various requirements: Dnn Permissions: in this case, you can specify if the user has view permissions, this applies User Identity: in this case you can specifiy a user GUID new in 9.30, requires the feature to be enabled Group ID(s): if a user is in any of these Dnn groups, the rule applies new in 9.30, requires the feature to be enabled Understanding Grants If a permission applies, it will grant the current user some rights - like creating or editing data. Grants are internally coded as a letter of the alphabet, like: c for create d for delete č for create drafts only f for full (all) permissions A grant can contain multiple rights - like crud for create, read, update, delete. Many grants like f will automatically grant other things (obviously). Default Permissions It's important to understand that for many scenarios, default permissions already apply. Super-users may always do everything, and admins may read/write all data. These default permissions cannot be reduced with new permissions at the moment, so an admin always has read/write and cannot be degraded to lower permissions. Using Permissions in Code As of now, the permissions API isn't final, so if you want to use it in code, you can immitate code you can find in the source. But these commands will change when the API is final, so you'll end up making adjustments.

    "keywords": "Customize the Search-Index Results (Dnn ☢️ only) you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .prepare-all { visibility: visible; } Dnn has a built-in search engine which crawls all the modules asking them for data. Every 2sxc module will be queried and will give the search index all the entities which are given to this module. Default Scenarios If a view shows data which was added by the editor these items will be in the Default stream and there may also be a single item in the Header stream. This data is given to the search index. This applies to both single-item templates as well as to lists. Note that Presentation items are not given to the search index as they should only contain settings how to show something, and not the real relevant data. If a view shows data from a Query then all the streams of that query will be given to the search index. Why Customize the Search Index? You can customize this behavior to your hearts desire. Here are typical reasons to do so: You may show the same items in many places - for example the Home page may show the top 3 news, but search results shouldn't point to these. A list/details setup would have each item in the list-view, but the search result should lead it to the details view You may want to exclude some query-streams in the search results - like exclude the categories-stream since it may not be relevant Ways to Customize the Search Results There are two ways to customize the search results: Using configuration new in v12 Using a separate code file which does this new in v12 Using code inside a Razor file not recommended, but works in older versions of 2sxc Customize the Search Results Using Configuration The following configuration options let you specify how data is handed to the Search Indexer. These options are set in the View configuration. Tip If you expect to use the same template in many places but need different search-configurations, just configure multiple views using different Search configs. Ensure Default Search Behavior By default the data given to the Module is also provided to the search. This is what it looks like in the View-Configuration. Don't Show Any Data in the Search Results Reasons for doing this: If you have views showing extracts of data (like the top 3 news) which are already added to the search index on the full news list, then you may create a Top News view which shouldn't return data If you show a tag-cloud this may not make sense to include in a search index This is where you can find the settings in the view configuration: Exclude Query-Streams from the Search Results In some cases your View may use a Query containing a lot of streams like Default and Categories, where only Default would make sense to include in the search. For this you can simply configure what streams you want. Note that these UIs automatically appear if you are using a Query: Custom Search-Index Using Code For very advanced cases you will want full control over what lands in the search index. To implement this, you can create your own Search Mapper in C#. This is how to configure this: 👉 Read about Custom Search in C# here Note In older versions of 2sxc (between 6 and 12) the Search Customization code was placed in the Razor file. This is deprecated and should not be used any more.

Tip In 2sxc/EAV we talk about Configuration when something has a standard set of properties and about Settings when the properties can vary dynamically. So an App-Configuration contains standardized aspects like the Folder it's in, while App-Settings can be a dynamic set of properties that are different in each App. Resources on the other hand are simply meant for language/culture specific labels, logos and similar. They are also dynamic, so they can have as many values as you need. Settings and Resources are Stacked Settings and Resources can be configured at any level of the application.

In C#/Razor you can access the Settings Stack using the Settings object and the Resources Stack using the Resources object. Note: there are some global ADAM Settings that can be configured in a different way, but it's not standardized/finalized yet, so not public, and we'll try to move that into the new standard.

Read about configuring them in the Settings Stack in 2sxc ✨ new!. In C#/Razor you can access the Settings Stack using the Settings object and the Resources Stack using the Resources object. App Level App Configuration Apps have a standard App-Configuration containing their version, name, folder etc. In Razor you can access this on the dynamic App.Configuration object. App Settings and Resources Apps can have custom App-Settings and App-Resources which every app manages itself. The names/types of these settings can be freely configured, as each App has a Content-Type called App-Settings which can have different fields as needed. You can also configure the standardized SettingsSystem/ResourcesSystem. In C#/Razor you can access the Settings Stack using the Settings object and the Resources Stack using the Resources object. View Level View Configuration Each view has View-Configuration containing the name, how it works with data and more. In Razor you can access basic View information on the CmsContext.View object, like the Identifier or the Edition. See ICmsView View Configuration was introduced ca. v4 and made accessible to Razor in v12.02 View Settings and Resources A view can have Views-Settings and View-Resouces which apply to all uses of this View. Since View-Settings could be re-used in various views, the concept more flexible than App Settings/Resources, meaning that you could re-use both the content-type as well as the settings data. In C#/Razor you can access the Settings Stack using the Settings object and the Resources Stack using the Resources object. Content-Type Level Content-Type Configuration Each Content-Type has Content-Type Configuration with the description, icon and more. The Configuration can be multi-language. Content-Type Settings and Resources There are no Content-Type settings or resources. Attribute (Field) Level Attribute Configuration Each Attribute / Field can be configured as needed. The configuration options depend on the Attribute-Type. The Configuration can be multi-language. Attribute Settings and Resources There are no Attribute Settings or Resources. Entity (Item) Level Entity Configuration, Resources and Settings An Entity just has the data it caries, and no additional intrinsic Configuration, Settings or Resources. Entities themselves are multi-language. Per Entity-Use (Item-Use) Settings aka Presentation Settings Items can have a per-use setting called Presentation - see Content-Presentation. This means that when the item is shown in a specific view, there may be settings which configure how it's to be shown. Since each View may need different settings (a map View could need other presentation-settings than a text/image View) this is specific to each use of an Entity. Per List-Use Settings aka Header-Presentation Settings If a View is configured to be a List then it can also have a Header and also Header Presentation Setttings which work just like Content-Presentation.

Take a look at this illustration: Assume the Blog App has a List View which needs Settings.Images.Content. The first Blog will look for it in the sequence of the blue arrows. The second will look in the sequence of the yellow arrows. So each Blog could get a different Setting, depending on where it is configured or overwritten. Settings Sources and Priorities The Settings are stacked in the following priority: ViewCustom - dynamic settings configured in the View AppCustom - the dynamic App-Settings (see App-Settings) of an App AppSystem - The SettingsSystem in the current App AncestorCustom - Optional, only on inherited Apps - App-Settings on ancestor app (v13) AncestorSystem - Optional, only on inherited Apps - SettingsSystem on ancestor app (v13) SiteCustom - an optional, manually created dynamic App-Settings on the Primary App of the current site SiteSystem - an optional SettingsSystem in the Primary App of the current site GlobalCustom - an optional, manually created dynamic App-Settings on the Global System App GlobalSystem - an optional SettingsSystem on the Global System App PresetSystem - the SettingsSystem which are included in the installation of 2sxc There is no setting called ViewSystem or PresetCustom. Review the Settings-Stack In case you need to see what setting applies to what view, you can easily analyze this in the App Administration. There you can see each setting and what source it came from + you can analyze all the sources which configure this setting: Next we'll explain where you can configure settings for different effects / scopes. Global Settings which Affect All Sites Global Settings for all sites are configured in the Global System App. It's usually on Zone 1 and App 1. go to the Global System App using this checklist. for Global System-Settings just edit them here for Global Custom-Settings just edit the App-Settings of the global app Tip This stuff is fairly new, and in rare cases new global settings don't automatically propagate to the sites.

Thisis feature has existed long before the stack was invented. See App Settings. View Settings which Affect a specific View As of v12.04 Views are only meant to have Custom Settings. It is still possible to override SystemSettings just by creating a field which has the same name, but we don't recommend it. To create Custom View Settings, create a custom content-type in the Configuration scope and use it in the view. See View Settings (Advanced ⚠).

Since 2016, Google requires all new domains using maps to first get a key. Because of this, the included maps include a demo-key which works, but you shouldn't use it in production. Consequences if you don't Replace the Key If you only disable the warning we added to the JS, then it would work for a short time. But it will randomly fail some time in the future, when your site is live. So don't try that. Why will it fail randomly? The included key can only generate a few thousand maps per day. If people start using it in production, then these maps will be added up. So every day a few thousand maps will work, and the rest will fail. This will feel very random, because all the maps generated on other sites are counted too. 👉 So you must use your own maps API key How to Change the API Key History Global Maps Settings introduced in v12.04"

    "keywords": "Recipes in Image Resize Settings in 2sxc you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .data-configuration { visibility: visible; } Version 13.10 will introduce a new ImageService which can generate advanced multi-resolution img and picture tags. As the configuration can be quite complex, it is explained here: A Resize Recipe A resize recipe has the following values, most of which are optional: Resize Settings variants (string) - determines which variant resolutions will be provided width (int) size of the initial image before variants are applied Restrictions forFactor if set, the rule will only apply to images which should be resized to this factor forCss if set, the rule will only apply to images when the page uses this Css Framework forTag if set, the rule will only apply to this tag type - either img or source Additional Effects setWidth (bool) will add an appropriate width attribute to the img tag if width is known setHeight (bool) will add an appropriate height attribute to the img tag if height is known attributes (Dictionary<string, object>) lists additional tag-attributes to apply to the img tag This is an example of a simple resize recipe: { \"recipe\": { // Means the initial image will be 700px wide \"width\": 700, // This will generate 3 variants: 700px, 1400px and 350px \"variants\": \"1*, 2*, 0.5*\", \"attributes\": { // This will always add an img-fluid class to the img-tag \"class\": \"img-fluid\" } } } Tip In v14.09 we updated the editor to use a JSON schema, so you should now get intellisense 😉. Variants variants is a string which tells us which variants to generate. It is comma-separated. There are three different ways to specify the variants: By multiplier - marked by * or no trailing character 1* means the original image will be used 2* means the image will be resized to 2 times its original size 0.5* means the image will be resized to half its original size By Pixel size marked by w 700w means the image will be resized to 700px wide 1400w means the image will be resized to 1400px wide 350w means the image will be resized to 350px wide By Screen Pixel Density marked by x 1x means the image will be used as is, for normal screen pixel density 2x means the image will be douled in size for 2x screen pixel density 3x means the image will be trippled in size for 3x screen pixel density Warning It's tempting to mix these, but only * and w can be combined. Trying to combine x (pixel density) with any of the others results in an invalid configuration which the browser cannot handle. It will not generate an error, but the browser will usually then just ignore the x variants. Adding Many Recipes A perfect resizing system must actually behave differently in many scenarios. Here are some reasons, why we need many recipes: If we use Bootstrap5 we may want to add the class img-fluid, but not if we use Tailwind If we want an image that fits 1/2 the content-area and we have Bootstrap5, then 100% is 1230px, but a 50% image is 600px because of paddings So a really amazing configuration will need a LOT of recipes - easily 10-20 per CssFramework. This is how it's done: { // Default Recipe \"recipe\": { \"width\": 1400, \"variants\": \"1*, 2*, 0.5*\", \"setWidth\": true, // Sub-Recipes, which inherit all the settings from main, unless they override it \"recipes\": [ { // This section would only affect Bootstrap5 \"forCss\": \"bs5\", \"width\": 1230, \"attributes\": { \"class\": \"img-fluid\" }, // Sub-Sub-Recipes, which inherit from the BS5 and from main, unless they override it \"recipes\": [ { \"forFactor\": \"1\", \"width\": 1230 }, { \"forFactor\": \"1/2\", \"width\": 600 }, { \"forFactor\": \"12/3\", \"width\": 400 }, { \"forFactor\": \"12/4\", \"width\": 300 } ] }, { // This section would only affect non-Bootstrap5, as that would match first \"setWidth\": false, // override default to false \"attributes\": { \"class\": \"img\" } } ] } } Tip Sub-Recipes inherit everything from the parents. This is so you are DRY - you don't have to repeat yourself. It's important to know that at runtime this is flattened to a table. So the hierarchy you see in the JSON is purely to make the configuration easier to write. Tip Attributes are cummulative, so if a parent-node has attributes and a child-node has other attributes, they will be merged. Child node attributes will replace parent node attributes. To reset an attribute which the parent had set already, use null on the child node. History Advanced Json configuration with Recipe added in v13.05, to be released v13.10"

If you're looking for information about the Content-App go here. Content vs. Data Data in itself is just sets of values without context and meaning. An Entity containing a Title, Body and Image is Data. If you would find this in a database, and the title read Read more about this it would be fairly meaningless in itself. Tip A lot of data is managed in terms of lists and details which makes it useful that way. A Catalog is usually Data-Driven and this makes sense - the list/details templates will then make it useful. On the other hand we have Content placed on a specific page in a specific position, where the reader experiences it in the context and meaning of other stuff on the same page. Tip Content is created by editors on the page and the editor ensures that it makes sense together with other content on the same page. Content is Information The editor gives the Data context and meaning, and as such it becomes more useful. It becomes Information. So in summary: Data + Context = Meaning = Information The 2sxc/EAV CMS ensures that the editor experiences this as such, and doesn't feel like she's editing Data when adding Content. Content Blocks 2sxc keeps track of the pieces that belong together as Content Blocks.

    "keywords": "Content Presentation Settings you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .data-entities, .context-box-summary .process-razor-app { visibility: visible; } When Data is used as Content it can also have Presentation settings. This is important because the same piece of content (like an Address) may need to be visualized different ways depending on how it's used. Quick Example Let's say we have an Address of 2sic in Switzerland as Data, and we're using it in a few places: In the footer of the website we're just showing it, the template says how it's shown In the We make Websites Page we have a CTA (Call to Action) with two addresses, and the 2sic address is configured to be highlighted using the Presentation We have a Contact Page where it's shown in a Google-Maps - there we configured the Presentation to use a pink pin Edit Behavior Since the Presentation is directly connected to the Item it's showing, the Edit-UI will open both items for editing together: More Use-Case Examples You have a template that shows simple content, and sometimes the title should be <h1>, sometimes <h2>, etc. Instead of creating 6 different templates, it would be easier to allow simple configuration of the heading-tag. This kind of presentation-configuration is handled by the Presentation-entity. Your Title/Text/Image allows the user to place the image no the right or on the left side. Instead of creating multiple templates, let's just let the user configure the variation he wants. This too is handled by the Presentation-entity. A complex template like a Google-map can configure 10-20 different parameters. These should not be set in the address which we will show - because these parameters have nothing to do with the address itself. So we need a way to provide 10-20 input-fields, drop-downs etc. - but not mix it with the address itself. These 10-20 input fields would be handled in a Presentation-entity. The same piece of information - like the address of 2sic - could be shown on different pages. Each instance might have some presentation configuration that differs from the other ones. It would be impossible to configure this if the config-fields were in the address-entity. So we place them in a separate Presentation-entity. Demo / Defaults Behavior One thing we discovered, is that configurable templates can be annoying because often there is a default configuration which applies to 90%. For example, if you create a configurable heading-tag <h1> through <h6>, usually 90% of the cases need <h1> because this is used on every page. Such defaults are handled easily by providing the template with a default-presentation entity containing these common settings. These will automatically be used if not overruled. Important Presentation Settings are not changed in 90% of all cases, so use Defaults whenever possible! Very often the Presentation contains default settings which are often left untouched. In these cases the Presentation-item is not stored, but the Demo-data is provided automatically. This allows you to update the defaults an any time and it will be reflected on all items which have unmodified Presentation settings. Here's what Presentation looks like when inheriting defaults: This is what Presentation looks like when you set it on the current item: Available on each Content-Item and on Header Presentation is available on each Content item and also in the Header (if a View is configured to have a List). Each Content item will have it's own presentation settings. The View configuration determines if there is a Presentation setting on Content (or Header) and what Content-Type is to be used. Use in Code In C# you will usually do things like @Content.Presentation.Color or similar. Check the C# API Docs for this. In Tokens you will usually do things like [Content:Presentation:Color]. Check the Tokens docs. Real Example Example: Using the Presentation to control the heading-tag in a template The Content-Types Simple Content - with the following fields Title (text, 1 line) Content (wysiwyg-text) Image (link to an image file) Presentation for Simple Content with the following field Heading (text, drop-down containing h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) The template configuration specifies the simple-content as the content type, and the presentation-for-simple-content as the Presentation-type. The user now has an additional section in the Edit-UI to configure the presentation. The Template This The template would then contain the following fragment: Token Instead of the classic <h1>[Content:Title]</h1> it would have <[Presentation:Heading]>[Content.Title]</[Presentation:Heading]> Razor Instead of the classic <h1>@Content.Title</h1> ...it would have <@Presentation.Heading>@Content.Title</@Presentation.Heading> Power-Feature: Using Default-Values in this Presentation Now remember that probably 90% of all use cases for this will want an <h1> tag. It would be annoying to have to specify this every time, so please create a demo-entity and assign it in the template-configuration. Features and Behavior of Presentation-Data Presentation-Types are optional, templates don't require them Default-Values are optional, but highly recommended Data / Values in a presentation-content-type are not indexed by the search Presentation-Items are unique for every use. So if you show a piece of content in many places, each occurrence can have different presentation-settings Content-Items can have a presentation... ...List Headers can have their own, different presentation. This is used to configure the list (for example, how many items to show before paging) ...and List Headers can also have their own default presentations for fallback The UI always allows the editor to revert back to the default-settings History Introduced in 2sxc v3.0"

If you change the technical name (BlogPost to BlogEntry) then your code needs to be updated You can delete Content-Types at any time When you delete a Content-Type, all Entities/Items of that type are deleted Content-Types have additional descriptions and help-texts which are shown in the Edit-UI Content-Types can also have an icon, but that's only used in Content Mode Nice to Know: Edit Fields of a Content-Type You can always create new fields on a Content-Type When you add new fields, then existing data will have that field, but no values on these fields You can always delete existing fields on a Content-Type When you remove fields, existing data will lose those values You can always rename fields of a Content-Type When you change the display name of a field (like Persons Photo to Profile Picture) the technical field name doesn't change, so your code doesn't need modification. If you change the technical field name (like ProfilePic to ProfilePhoto) the code must be updated Nice to Know: Export / Import Content-Type Definition You can export a Content-Type into a JSON format You can import the Content-Type into another App using upload or drag-n-drop Important Exporting the Content Type Definition exports the schema / fields of that type. Exporting all the Items of a Content-Type is a table-export of all the data. Content-Type - More Information Identity of a Content Type: Name and StaticName Each content-type has a Name, which is nice for a human to read, use and program with. There is a second identifier called StaticName which is usually a GUID, but in rare cases it's a string like App-Settings. This identifier is used internally - for example when a View references a Content-Type. Storage Most Content-Types in your App are stored in the SQL database. System and global Content-Types are stored in the file system. These are called File-Stored Content-Types Field Types Each field will be of a simple type like text/string, number, boolean (yes/no) or other. You can find the list of types here. Relationships Fields can also be of type Entity in which case they point to other items. This would then establish a Relationship Input Forms and Fields (like WYSIWYG) The input mask is automatically generated from the Content-Type. Based on the specifications, it will generate the correct Input-Field like a simple text field, a multiline text field, a WYSIWYG or even a file-uploader. Scopes Content-Types have a Scope. Read about it Content-Type Scopes APIs ToSic.Eav.Data Namespace has almost everything you see here IContentType defines what fields exist, it's the ContentType / Schema IContentTypeAttribute contains the definition of an attribute ContentTypeMetadata, IMetadataOf contains information about the content-type (like nicer descriptions).

What is an App Shared Content-Type? App Shared Content Types are a Content Types which are defined in one App and re-used in specific other Apps. They can only be used inside the App which are configured to share the definition The App data is in the export/import, but not the Content-Type Definition If you import an App with such data, the App containing the definition must be imported first. These Content-Types are stored in the SQL database You rarely want to use this. How it works Shared Content-Types are defined in a Primary App which manages this type. Other Slave Apps are configured to also use this Content-Type. They automatically inherit every configuration of the primary App even when the schema changes. Why does this Feature exist? The feature was originally introduced in 2sxc 1.0 because at that time we didn't have Global Shared Content-Types It has since been used in various complex sites. An example is a installation which has many Sites, each having the same News App. In such scenarios it's hard to keep changes synchronized, so it's usually implemented as follows: A primary App is on a hidden Site which just manages the Content-Types A template App is configured to use thes Content-Types. It usually also uses shared Templates etc. The template App is then exported and imported in each site where needed. Why would you want to use this? If you are creating a complex system with many portals and apps which should share the schema Why would you not want to do this? Using Shared Content-Types is fairly technical, so the developer must understand what this is. History Introduced in 2sxc 1.0"

Warning This is a very advanced topic which less than 1% of all developers use. You almost certainly will not need this. So if you start playing around with this, make sure that you really need this. What is a Global Content-Type? Global Content Types are a Content Types which are defined in a central location and available in all Apps of your system. These are custom Content-Types which are treated like System Content-Types. They can be used inside every single App The App data is in the export/import, but not the Content-Type Definition. If you import an App with such data, the Global Type must be configured first. These Content-Types are stored in the file system For most scenarios you don't want to use this. How it works Global Content-Type are stored in special folders as JSON files and are loaded by the system when it starts. From then on they are automatically available in all apps for use. Since the schema is not stored in the SQL database, the Entities cannot use the normal storage system. Instead they are stored as JSON Entities in the SQL tables. Why does this Feature exist? 2sxc uses this concept for all the internal Content-Types. So any time you edit Field-settings or Visual-Query configurations, they use Global Content-Types. We also have some really sophisticated solutions which use this feature. Why would you want to use this? If you are creating a complex system with many portals and apps which should share the schema Why would you not want to do this? If you only want to share the Content-Type across 2-3 Apps, you should prefer App Shared Types instead If you have one specific App (like News) which is installed on many Sites you should prefer App Shared Types instead Important Warnings Since the data for the Global Content-Types is stored as JSON Entities there are a few drawbacks you should be aware of: If you plan on using the raw SQL data (not recommended anyhow) then the JSON format used in Global Content-Types adds quite a lot of complexity. If you ever rename fields in the Global Content-Type, the stored data will not follow the rename. From the systems perspective it has lost the old field and gotten a new one. Create a Global Content-Type Assume you really want to do this, here's how: Create the Content-Type in the normal way Export the Content-Type Definition as JSON Store it in your global custom folder (you may need to create these folders) In Dnn: [system-root]/DesktopModules/ToSIC_SexyContent/App_Data/system-custom/contenttypes In Oqtane: TODO Restart the system You should now have this Content-Type show up in every App. Update a Global Content-Type Make the updates in the original system Re-export the JSON Overwrite the original file Restart your system Delete a Global Content-Type Remove the JSON file Restart the system Best Practices From our experience the main use case for Global Content-Types is very technical, so the content-editor usually doesn't need to see this. So we strongly recommend placing it in an own Scope. History Introduced in 2sxc 9.7"

These files can be anywhere in the system, but the DLL will have to tell 2sxc to load them. Limitation: No GUI As of now the system will pick up the content-types stored there and everything works. BUT there is no built-in UI to edit these. We (2sic) can easily create content-types in a normal 2sxc and export them to json for this purpose, but as of now there is no GUI to do so. This should not affect you, as it's not meant to be managed by anybody else than us as of now.

Use that for fields which should behave like variables and not be saved. Features The basic empty field doesn't have any features, since all the features are in the sub-types. Sub-Types of Empty Fields empty-default - a UI-only field for things like grouping fields together under a title empty-end - a UI-only field to close a Field-Group empty-message - just a message in the edit form Shared Settings Doesn't have shared settings.

Entity or Item data is a basic data type and is used to mark item-relationships, like books-to-authors or blog-to-tags. Features The basic entity field simply allows you to select items of a specific type, with various add/remove/create/delete features. Sub-Types of Entity Fields entity-default - standard selector with type, add/remove, one/multi, delete, etc. entity-query for picking entities which were pre-processed in a query Shared Settings All Entity-Field Types have the following settings: Basic Entity Type Advanced UI Settings Multiple Items Enable Edit Enable Create New Enable Add Existing Enable Remove Enable Delete Specials of the Entity type: The entity-type has these specials it's good to know about It's always a list It preserves the relationship order Special #1: It's always a List Since it could contain 1 or many items (and the configuration can change whenever you want), reading it always means reading a list. So you'll always use something like this (C#): // full name of author var fn = Book.Author[0].FullName; // in case you're not sure if the author was added or null, you can do var fn2 = (Book.Author.Any() ? Book.Author[0].FirstOrDefault : \"\"); // This will also work in newer versions of C# // making fullName either the name, or a null var fn3 = Book.Author.FirstOrDefault()?.FullName; // the following won't work! var wontWork = Book.Author.FullName; // this won't work Or the same in JavaScript: var fn = Book.Author[0].FullName; // in case you're not sure if it has any // this uses the JS-syntax which returns the last-value of an && condition var fn = Book.Author && Book.Author[0].FullName; Special #2: It preserves Order If the user said a book has 2 authors: Daniel Abraham Then it's sometimes useful to preserve the order - in this case Daniel was probably the main author and Abraham helped out a bit. To allow for this, the Entity field will keep the order of items as they were added. Side-effect: Sometimes you want to have an A-Z order when showing items. As the order is not auto-sorted, you will have to do this yourself if you want to have them sorted. Use LINQ to do that. Technical Information Storage in the SQL Database in the EAV-Model This is stored in a special relationships-table, so internally the current DB IDs are used to track relationships. Storage in the SQL Database in the JSON-Model This is stored as an array of strings, which contain the GUIDs of the related information.

Hyperlink data is a basic data type and is actually a string, but on reading it's automatically converts to an output-friendly format. It's used for normal links, page or file/image references as well as for complete sets of files (like image galleries). Features The basic hyperlink (links/files) field is used for normal links, page or file/image references as well as for complete sets of files (like image galleries) Sub-Types of Hyperlink Fields hyperlink-default - it's input field for normal links, page or file/image references. In menu it has ADAM (automatic digital asset manager), page picker, image manager and file manager. hyperlink-library - it's for complete sets of files (like image galleries). Shared Settings All Hyperlink-Field Types have the following settings: File Filter - list of extensions allowed in file/image picker. Example: .jpg,.bmp,.png,.gif Paths - this is only needed if you use the old file pickers (not ADAM). Root paths for the picker dialog - ideal if you want all images for this Content-Type to be in the same folder use the syntax foldername - without \"/\" in front to specify a subfolder of the portal-root. Examples are \"Apps\" or \"Gallery\" or \"Employees/Photos\" you can also use subfolders - that would be \"Employees/Photos\" always remember that this folder must already exist, and Dnn must know that it is visible (readable) by the editing user. There are cases where the security settings were not set correctly in dnn - then the file picker won't show anything. Default Dialog - none, ADAM, page picker, image manager or file manager Show Page Picker - show page picker in the drop-down Show Image Manager - show image manager in the drop-down Show File Manager - show file manager in the drop-down Show Adam - show the ADAM (automatic digital asset manager) in the drop-down menu. Buttons - will let you specify which buttons are visible directly. The default is \"adam,more\" but you could also do \"adam,page,more\" or just \"page\". File / image are currently not supported, because as of now, Dnn doesn't have a good image/file browser so we discourage its use. Automatic Conversions of file and page references The hyperlink data internally can contain values like: http://whatever/whatever - will not be converted /some-relative-url - will not be converted page:42 - will usually be converted to the real url of the page in Dnn page:42?something=value - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters page:42#something=value - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters file:2750 - will usually be converted to the real url of the file in Dnn file:2750?w=200 - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters (like for thumbnails) file:2750#page=2 - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters (like for pdf-page-links) In 99% of all use cases, you want to generate html with a real link, which is why the content-objects in Razor will deliver an http:... instead of file:27. Some demo-code: // assume that Content is a dynamic entity // assume that Image actually contains \"file:274\" <img src=\"@Content.Image\"> // the result is now <img src=\"/portals/0/adam/20603963uaothutaoer/daniel.jpg\"> Accessing the Real Inner Value In rare cases you may want the originl page:22 instead of the converted value. To do this, use AsEntity(yourObject) and then use the EAV API on IEntity to read the underlying original value. Special: Hyperlink Libraries A special use case is Libraries - where a hyperlink-field doesn't actually contain anything, but is a placeholder for ADAM assets. In such a scenario, you will use AsAdam(...) in your code to get the folders/files in the ADAM repository. Null Value Possible In some cases you may add a field to a type which already has Entities created previously. In this case the old data doesn't have a value for the field. If this happens, the field will return null, so you may need to catch this special exception in your code. A common shorthand to work with this is either the ?? operator or using RazorBlade with Text.Has(...) or Text.First(...).

Features include: Automatic image resizing of wysiwyg-images using the <picture> tag Image arrangements which work on all screens (eg. 4-in-a-row on desktop, but under-each-other on mobile) Optimized CSS to make this possible Special spacers to create proper gaps where necessary Image text wrapping so that multiple side-images are under each other and not staggered 👉🏽 See Field Input-Type string-wysiwyg Rich-Mode new 16.01 Configure a String-Wysiwyg The mode is configured in the normal field settings.

When this configuration is set, it will: Provide buttons in the Edit UI to align images in a special way add splitters to reset content alignments after the splitter add spacers to create gaps of various sizes in content specify resizing using css-classes for the server-side image-resizing Allow the razor .Html(...) to automatically resize images make all images responsive using <picture> tags automatically add spacers To make all this happen it needs this: The new mode setting The new behavior in the Edit UI The new .Html(...) API Internal server-side code to find the images and replace them with responsive <picture> tags Special CSS to make it all work (see below) A special debug mode to help you in optimizing the CSS for your use case (see below) The Edit UI If a string-wysiwyg is configured to behave in the new rich mode, the toolbars will look as follows: The new buttons on the second row allow you to add spacers of various sizes. When you add images or spacers which resulting in extra padding, the padding will be shown in the UI as follows: When selecting a spacer, the context-toolbar will look as follows: When selecting an image, the context-toolbar will look as follows: This allows you to change the alignment (left/right) and to specify the size of the image. Important In the classic wysiwyg-mode, the image-alignment was done using the float css-property and the width uses the width css-property. In this new Rich mode, it will only set CSS classes like wysiwyg-left or wysiwyg-50. So the final output will only change, if the CSS definition exists. This happens automatically, when you use the .Html(...) method. CSS To make all of this work, we use a list of CSS classes which are applied in the edit-UI. The output must of course also have these classes, so that the final result looks the same. These are the classes that make it work: wysiwyg-container is set on the wrapper <div> so the classes inside will only apply to this field wysiwyg-100, wysiwyg-50 etc. are width classes on the image wysiwyg-left, wysiwyg-right etc. are alignment classes on the image which also apply a padding to the opposite side wysiwyg-splitter are classes applied to <hr> tags to reset image alignment and ensure the next content start below it wysiwyg-spacer-0, wysiwyg-spacer-s etc. are classes applied to <hr> tags to create gaps of various sizes The built-in CSS for this is automatically added to the page when you use the .Html(...) method. It ensures correct sizing and will also re-order the images to be above the text on mobile. It also ensures that multiple images on the same line will properly align and not stagger. For example, 3 images each being 33% should have a padding after the first two, but not after the last one. Image arrangements which work on all screens (eg. 4-in-a-row on desktop, but under-each-other on mobile) Image text wrapping so that multiple side-images are under each other and not staggered You can also add your own CSS to make it look different. Debug CSS If you specify debug: true in the .Html(..., debug: true) method, it will add some CSS to the page to help you see what's going on. This will show you: the exact size/location/placement of the wysiwyg-container - shown in fading magenta exact sizes of images - shown in bright fading green paddings around images - shown as shaded areas spacings / gaps of splitters - shown as shaded areas History Introduced in v16.01 on Towel Day 2023 Shortlink: https://go.2sxc.org/wysiwyg-rich"

Let's start by looking where this fits in the stack: you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box2 .data-data { visibility: visible; } Tip The Edit UIs are automatically generated based on the Content-Type Schema which says what fields each kind of data has. App Data Model Every App contains Content-Types and Entities - like this: Content Types are the schema, they define what fields an entity has. Entities are the data-items, they contain the content. Let's look at each piece in detail. Content-types Content-types are the Schema. The are the rules which say that a Person has a FirstName, Photo and Birthday etc. An App usually has a lot of Content-Types. 👉 Content-Type (Schema/Object-Type) 👉 Content-Type Fields Global / Shared Types Usually a Content-Type is part of the App and only available inside that App. In rare cases you may have many sites (Portals) or many Apps which need the same Content-Type. In this case it's smarter to store this in a shared location. 👉 App Shared \"Ghost\" Content-Types (⚠) Global-Types are Content-Types which are stored in a system folder so they can be used in all Apps of an installation. 👉 Global Content-Types (⚠) Entities / Content-Items Entities are Dynamic Data Items. They always belong to a Content-Type and have all the fields specified in that Content-Type. This makes them very dynamic. A Person has different fields than a BlogPost All the Values in an Entity can also be multi-language by default 👉 Entities (Data, Records, Items) Assets (Images / Documents) Assets come in 2 Flavors: Private Assets and Shared Assets. Private Assets By default, assets uploaded in the UI belong to the Entity and to the Field they were added to. So the photo daniel.jpg belongs to the Field ProfilePhoto of the Entity Person #5020. Shared Assets If the editor expects to re-use an asset elsewhere and if the Content-Type configuration allows this, then the asset can also be stored in a shared location. 👉 Content Assets / Images / Documents ADAM - the Automatic Digital Asset Manager ADAM is a subsystem of 2sxc. It's responsible for managing the files and storing them in a way that assigns Private Assets to the Entities and Fields they belong to. 👉 ADAM - Automatic Digital Asset Management External Data External Data can come from anywhere. Here are some common scenarios: SQL data coming from the Dnn database or from another DB CSV data from a file which an editor updates from time to time SharePoint document lists or tables JSON data from another REST WebService External Data is retrieved using one of the following methods: a VisualQuery which was configured to get / filter / sort this data C# code creating DataSource objects to retrieve this data C# code using standard .net APIs to get / use this data Once the data is retrieved it can be used in Templates, WebAPIs, JavaScript and SPAs.

Multi-Language Attributes Every Attribute (like a Title) can be stored in multiple languages. So the data model of some content can look like this: Title en-US: Enjoy a Visit to our Headquarters de-DE: Genießen Sie einen Besuch in unserem Hauptquartier de-CH: Geniessen Sie einen Besuch in unserem Hauptquartier Photo *: file:7402 SloganImage en-US: file:7405 de-DE,de-CH: file:7406 GpsCoordinates en-US: { \"Long\": 74.6020030, \"Lat\": 53.002030060 } Employees (reference to other entities/items) *: [74, 592, 6030, 39] Some things to understand in the above data model: Title is translated in 3 languages (Germany/Switzerland only differing with ß vs ss) The Photo has the language * which means that it was edited before languages were enabled and doesn't map to any particular language The GpsCoordinates are only set in 1 language, so every language will show the same value The SloganImage is translated so en and de have different images The Employees relationship to other data is not translatable, and the order of the items is also preserved Language Assignment and Read/Write State Each Attribute or Property like Title has one or more Values. These Values are mapped to the Attribute with one or more languages. Each language-assignment also stores the read/write state for the UI. As such, a value can have different internal rules It can be assigned to one language only. It can be assigned to multiple languages and editable in the UI of each language. Changing it would change the value in all the languages. It can be assigned to multiple languages and editable in the UI of some of these languages. Changing it (in one of the editable languages) would change it in all assigned languages. The assigned languages which are not editable would always just show this language, but not enable editing in the UI. Relationships Cannot be Translated Relationships are not Translatable. If a Blog-Post references Tags, the same tags are referenced in all languages. Note that related items may again have multi-language properties, so even if the Authors list contains the same authors across languages, accessing the Bio of a related Author will probably return a different value. Assets are Multi-Language, but the Files are Shared Across Languages A link/file-field can have a different value in each language, but the files uploaded will be available to that field in the UI of every language. So a SloganImage field would show all the files that were uploaded to this field, but the selected file can be different in each language. This wil also affect Libraries of files - the libraries will always contain the same files/images in all languages. But if these files have Metadata, then that Metadata can be different in each language. Disable Translation for Individual Fields The UI can be configured to not allow translation of specific fields if this is desired (for example URL-key fields). See also Basics.Cms.Languages.Index. Internal Functionality When languages are enabled, this is what happens Every field can be translated individually - or you can translate all fields of an Entity On every Entity the primary language must always be created first The primary language will then serve as the fallback for all languages which have not been translated In addition to translating values you can also link them to other languages, so that editing a value in de-DE would automatically affect de-CH but not en-US History Introduced in 2sxc 2.0 Non-Translatable fields were made an option in 2sxc 11"

    "keywords": "Entity Relationships This explains Entity Relationships. For an overview check out Understanding Data.... Data can be related to other data, like when a Book belongs to a Category and also has an Author. Since all data-items are called Entities we call this Entity Relationships. Additionally, there are also Entities which explicitly enhance/describes another thing. That kind of relationship is called Metadata. How Entity-Relationships Work Each Entity has many fields, some containing text, numbers etc. but some can also point to another item. These kinds of fields are called Entity Fields. When configured correctly, an entity-field shows a dropdown of items. So in the case of a book, the Author field may show a dropdown of Person items. There are different types of relationships: 1:n means that one thing can refer to many other things - like a book which points to many categories n:1 means that many things can refer to one thing - like many books pointing to the same author n:n means that many things can refer to many things - like many blog-posts pointing to many tags (the blog can refer to many tags, and each tag may be pointed to by many blogs) 1:1 relationships are when one thing refers to one other thing, and neither are re-used again. This is not often used in CMSs. Relationships Preserve Item-Order Since 2sxc/EAV data is often used for Content-Management it's important to note that: Relationships preserve the Order of the Related Items. This means that an editor adding Author relationships to a Book can organize them in an order if he/she wishes to do this. The output template can then choose to either output these Authors in the order they were managed, or sort them by Title or other property if that would be more appropriate. Relationships are Cross-Language Values of Entities are multi-language, but relationships-connections apply to all languages. So the list of Authors is the same for all languages.

In 2sxc 9.30 a feature was added to add the context in code, using the Edit.Enable(...) command. Inner-Context for Inner Content When inner content is used, each block of inner-content will change the context, because it will have different IDs etc. So inner-content blocks will add their own context-attributes. See also [Edit.ContextAttributes](xref:Razor.ContextAttributes]. How JS Picks up the Context In most cases the context is picked up automatically - like in such a code: <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).run('edit', ...)\">edit</a> This kind of code traverses the HTML to look for the closes context-node, and uses it to figure out everything automatically. The second auto-pickup method uses the module/content-block ID, like this: <a onclick=\"$2sxc(4203).run('edit', ...)\">edit</a> This will also find the context, but instead of traversing the DOM upwards, it will check all DOM objects on the page and find the appropriate one for this ID. What's in the Context This information is just conceptual. Do NOT try to access these values in your code, because they will change, and it's not part of any public API!. The concept contains things like: versions (so that the UI can behave as needed and correctly load scripts with cache-breaking) urls so the GUI can perform certain actions correctly language information for the GUI various IDs like the current zone/app, item-IDs, module-IDs etc. Using Edit Context in Your Code You should not use this in your code, as it's not a public api and will change from time to time.

    "keywords": "QuickE (Quick Edit) you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .browser-edit { visibility: visible; } QuickE (pronounced quick-e) is the quick-edit feature inside 2sxc to quickly add / move modules and inner content blocks. It supports touch and usually is used with a mouseover. In the current version, it allows you to do the following in normal view-mode: add a content or app module on any position in a Dnn panes move / delete any Dnn module using a copy-paste concept send any Dnn module to an empty pane (which couldn't do paste, as the target is invisible) add a content or app content-block to any inner-content area move / delete any content-block inside an inner-content area Since version 2.0 you can also configure some of this at skin and template level. How to use By default any page that has any 2sxc module added will automatically load quickE because it needs it to provide buttons/toolbars for inner content blocks. We also recommend to include the JS in the skin by default, so that quickE is already enabled on empty pages as well. You can find the necessary asp.net web-control in our Bootstrap Instant Theme Here's how: <%@ Register tagprefix=\"Edit\" tagname=\"QuickEdit\" src=\"~/DesktopModules/ToSIC_SexyContent/DnnWebForms/Skins/QuickEdit.ascx\" %> <Edit:QuickEdit runat=\"server\" /> The above lines first tell .net that this control QuickEdit exists, and then adds it to the page using the <Edit:...> tag. Note that this tag won't create any HTML, it will just tell Dnn that it must load the relevant JavaScripts when a user is logged on. Once it's included, it will just work automatically. Auto-Disabled Module-Quick-Edit on Details Pages By default quickE will change it's behavior if it finds inner-content blocks. The reason is that often inner-blocks are found on child pages of something, for example in blog-post details. If the user could insert both modules and inner-content on a details page, then the user would often by accident insert modules (instead of content-blocks). The user would believe that he did the right thing, when in reality the newly added module would now show up on all other details-pages as well. Now there are cases where this auto-disable shouldn't happen - for example in accordeon-style modules which are used on normal pages. This can be configured as explained below: Configuring quickE Quick-Edit Since quickE 2.0 (released in 2sxc 8.7) you can now also configure it a bit.

Overview of UI Rules on Button icon color show classes title group position Icon &icon=icon-class-name allows you to set an alternate icon Since v14.07.05 you can also specify an SVG like this: &icon=<svg... This would use the specified SVG directly on the button, but there are some caveats: The SVG will need to auto-resize to fit the button. Because of that, your SVG will either need to specify a viewBox or it will be auto-calculated for you. Since an SVG usually contains many characters that won't work in a URL, it must be base64 encoded, so it's more like &icon=base64:PHN2ZyB... Color &color=... gives the button other colors Both settings and buttons can have an &color=... parameter. The ... can be just one color or two, like &color=red,green or &color=brown. When specifying colors you can either use standard names like red or HEX-codes like FF0000. You cannot use the # hash symbol, so when specifying hex-colors, always just write the characters. The button rendering system will auto-detect hex color codes. Note that you can also use semi-transparent hex-codes, like FF000088. Show Force show/hide a button. This is only used in cases where show is auto detected, and you wish to override it. &show=true or &show=false Most common use case is to force-show or hide an existing button. For example, if you think it's ok to show the delete button, just use delete&show=true Class Add more classes to your button for custom styling. &class=your-class add one or more classes to the button to affect styling Title &title=some-text - mouseover message Group This is used in toolbars which have many button groups - either the standard groups or groups you made yourself.

    "keywords": "Custom Toolbars you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .browser-edit { visibility: visible; } The standard toolbars are great for default use cases. But often you want to simplify the edit-UI even more, so that editors will be faster and make fewer mistakes. 2sxc 10.27+ offers a new way to build and create toolbars. Instead of the difficult to use object-structure it has a much simpler commands syntax. These are specs for the command syntax. Tip Read how to use in the How-To Customize Toolbars section. Overview The new toolbar builder works in this way: First, take a toolbar template - typically default or empty Then make changes like adding or removing buttons Optionally override certain defaults Render the toolbar with optional overrides These instructions are a simple list of strings. For example: toolbar=empty tells the system to load the empty template new?contentType=Person will add a button new for the type Person edit?entityId=5593 will add an edit button for the item 5593 These instructions are provided as a JSON array of strings - like this: [\"toolbar=empty\", \"new?contentType=Person\", \"edit?entityId=5593\"] Examples of Build-Instructions Every build instruction consists looks as follows: \"\" - an empty string is valid but not very useful \"/this is just a comment\" - a comment if you need to document something inline \"new\" or \"+new\" - add a new-button \"-edit\" - remove a button - like when slimming down a default toolbar \"%delete&show=true\" - a button modifier - to change a default (the delete button is always hidden by default) \"group=my-group\" or \"+group=my-group\" add a button-group \"+group=my-group&pos=2\" add a button group at index 2 (so in the 3rd-position, 0-based) \"new-quote=new?contentType=Quote\" - an identifier followed by a button name - when having multiple new buttons \"%more&color=red\" - a modifier which changes the color of the icon General Syntax of a Build-Instruction The general syntax is as follows (build-instruction)(&build-params optional)(?call-params optional) Build Instructions A build instruction consist of 1-3 parts an optional prefix like + to add a button or group (this is the default if no prefix is given) % to modify a default thing - like change a the color of the new-button - to remove a button or group from the list $ for system/global things (this is the default if the command is toolbar, params or settings) / a comment - like \"/here comes a special add-button\" a command and optional addition like toolbar - for setting the default toolbar template toolbar=default will load the default toolbar with all standard buttons toolbar=empty will load an empty toolbar without any buttons settings - for configuring the toolbar settings - see below params - for parameters which are used in all buttons - see below group - to add a group of buttons group=my-group-name gives the group a name, for placing buttons in it `-group= add, edit etc. - all known commands of buttons Build Parameters (&...) If you have a build-instruction and need to add some parameters you must separate them with an & and add the parameters in url-style, like &color=red. Build Parameters for Toolbar (toolbar) The toolbar currently doesn't have any additional parameters. But you can add &key=value which will be used as settings, if settings are not also provided. Build Parameters for Settings (settings) Settings affect how the toolbar is shown. These are the known settings: color=... - specify a different button - see color hover=left or =right or =none - default is right class=my-class to add one or more classes to the toolbar autoAddMore = auto default end if right-float, start if left-float, new in 14.07.05 end used to be the default start never new v14.07.05 Build Parameters for Params (params) Params don't have any additional settings - they only have parameters (after the ?). See below. Build Parameters for Groups (group) Groups currently don't have additional parameters. 👉🏼 see also Custom Toolbars: Button Groups Build Parameters for Buttons 👉🏼 see Button UI Rules Call Parameters (?) Most instructions can have additional call-parameters - separated by a ?.... For example, this would create an additional + button to create a new contact: add-contact=add?contentType=Contact Call Parameters for Toolbars & Settings The toolbar and settings don't have any additional parameters. But you can use ?key=value&key2=value on the toolbar, which will be used as params if params are not provided. Call Parameters for Params Params at the global level will be used by all buttons. The most common params are entityId=some-number - mainly used for edit, delete etc. entityGuid=guid-guid-guid - mainly used for delete contentType=ContentTypeName - mainly used for adding new items title=some-text - mainly used to show a title when asking to delete something isPublished=true|false prefill:Field1=val1&prefill:Field2=val2 etc. for=someKey or for=targetType,keyType,key for list management useModuleList=true|false sortOrder=# Using Prefill Parameters Prefill parameteres are mainly used for creating new items like add?contentType=Book&prefill:Title=This is nice title The syntax is a bit special because you may need to add multiple prefill parameters, like: add?contentType=Book&prefill:Title=Please enter name&prefil:Author=unknown Since many things can go wrong with prefills, this is what you need to know All prefill parameters start with prefill: followed by the field name. The field name is case sensitive, so you'll probably have to write Title instead of title. You can use multiple prefills, like ...&prefill:Title=Hello&prefill:Intro=welcome! When using special characters which cause trouble in urls, make sure they are uriEncoded. If you do the prefill using the razor tag @Edit.Toolbar(...) or @Edit.TagToolbar(...) this happens automatically, but if you use JavaScript to prepare it, you should use encodeURIComponent to prepare the value (not the prefix prefill:...) Special considerations for each type of field for text fields just write the text as is like prefill:Title=Todays News - remember to encode if you expect special characters. When you encode things, you can also prefill html. for number fields just use prefill:Priority=47 for boolean switch fields just use prefill:UseLightbox=true for dates we suggest to use the same ISO format prefill:PublicationDate=2020-04-01 as this will always be recognized correctly. If you use another format like 4/1/2020 you risk that the UI will auto-detect the date based on the user and maybe pick the wrong number as the month. for dates with time you should really use ISO with Zulu time code like prefill:ShowFrom=2020-04-01T10:30Z. The Z at the end means that it won't adjust for time zones - otherwise the UI may show a different time. for related entities (like prefilling a category) use the target Guid, like prefill:Category=b7c1c2e1-4896-4999-a0bc-87ddf3ce31cb. As of now, you must always use the Guid, IDs are not supported because as the app is exported and re-imported, the IDs will change. to assign multiple entities (like for category fields with multiple categories), separate them with commas, like prefill:Category=b7c1c2e1-4896-4999-a0bc-87ddf3ce31cb,91753b4d-4932-4b22-af1c-f6ac2b76c67a Using Filter Parameters Filter parameteres are mainly used for creating dialogs which show only some items like contentitems?contentType=Book&filter:ModuleId=573 The syntax is a bit special because you may need to add multiple filter parameters, like: contentitems?contentType=Book&filter:ModuleId=573&filter:Author=Daniel Since many things can go wrong with filters, this is what you need to know All prefill parameters start with filter: (without an s) followed by the field name. The field name is case sensitive, so you'll probably have to write Title instead of title. You can use multiple filters, like ...&filter:Title=Hello&filter:ModuleId=52 When using special characters which cause trouble in urls, make sure they are uriEncoded. If you do the prefill using the razor tag @Edit.Toolbar(...) or @Edit.TagToolbar(...) this happens automatically, but if you use JavaScript to prepare it, you should use encodeURIComponent to prepare the value (not the prefix filter:...) Using Metadata Parameters The metadata parameters are for creating new metadata or editing existing data. There is a short and a long syntax: for=key - for example, for=file:930 - this will create metadata for a CMS-object with the ID file:930. for=targetType,keyType,key like for=10,string,file:930 which has the same effect as the previous example. Note Metadata buttons always also need a contentType parameter and usually an entityId parameter. So if an entity already has this metadata-assignment, the dialog will show an edit for that and not create a new one. The entityId should be 0 when no entity exists yet. To use metadata, read more about metadata (TODO).

    "keywords": "In-Page Edit-Item Toolbars and Buttons you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .browser-edit { visibility: visible; } 2sxc provides super-fast in-page buttons and toolbars for the content-editor to manage and edit everything. The system is very advanced, so what at first may seem trivial can become very complex as you go deeper into customizing it. Best Practice: Hover vs. Inline Toolbars The toolbars for the editor can be hovering above the elements - usually appearing on mouse-over, or directly inline. Hover-toolbars can also be configured to always be visible, but this is a rare use case. Recommendation Hover-Toolbars are highly recommended. These appear when the mouse moves over the item to be edited. It gives the editor a perfect preview of the page, without cluttering the screen with buttons. Toolbars which hover and are always visible make sense for buttons which the editor may not discover on his own if they are not always visible, or when the item to hover on would be very small, and hard to discover. Inline (non-hovering) toolbars which are always visible should be used as rarely as possible. A good use for this are admin-tables where each row should directly show the edit-button in a buttons-column. How the System Work To make the magic work, these parts are involved: Server side code detects that editing is allowed. This automatically adds context-information to the module in the form of a hidden JSON attribute. You can see these large attributes in the source-code if you are logged in. It also ensures that the edit-javascripts are loaded by the page. This is either auto-detected, because the user has edit-rights Or it was explicitly enabled using @Edit.Enable(...) in razor. Server side code adds stuff to mark where toolbars should appear... ...either (new in 2sxc 9.40) it adds hidden JSON attributes called sxc-toolbar='{...}' to any tag that should have a hover-menu with the desired configuration and settings, added like this <div @Edit.TagToolbar(...)>...</div> in razor ...or it adds an empty <ul toolbar='{...}' settings='{...}> tag to the page, also with the configuration and settings, added using @Edit.Toolbar(...) in razor or the [Content.Toolbar] equivalent in tokens. These toolbars can also hover using an old convention of adding an sc-element class, but that is deprecated since 2sxc 9.40. JavaScript on the client looks at the HTML and picks up both the special <ul> tags as well as all tags having the sxc-toolbar attribute, reads the configuration and generates the necessary html-tags with the buttons and hover-effects. Based on the context-information and the configuration it will choose if advanced button should appear (like edit-template, which only admins should see). Special hover-placement and other visual things are picked up from the settings. If an editor interacts with the menu, each click will result in JavaScript looking at the closest context-information in the page, and using this information to run a command like edit, new or template-develop. When a command has completed, certain code may reload the view, either using ajax or by reloading the page if ajax is not supported by this particular view. Short Example The toolbar system is 100% JavaScript but offers special helpers to improve the experience in other dev-environments. Here's a simple example using Razor: <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> @Content.Title </h1> This creates a invisible toolbar which appears and hovers when the mouse moves over the <h1> tag (if the user has edit-permissions). The toolbar has all the buttons for this Content item. The next example is similar, but instead of all default buttons it only shows the edit-button: <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, actions: \"edit\")> @Content.Title </h1> Basic Toolbar Concepts and Functionality each toolbar is specific to a content-item a page can have many toolbars, each for a different element / purpose usually toolbars are invisible until the mouse hovers over the area to be edited (best practice, but configurable) various show and hover/float behaviors each toolbar is fully customizable - both in regards to which buttons are shown as well as how they are grouped, how they look etc. toolbars are multi-language easy to add in your template or to your JS Apps mobile capable with shake support How to Use We'll try to provide you with full details of the toolbars for advanced use cases. But in most cases you will need the default toolbars minimal or no customizations. For these common cases you should continue on. Razor @Edit.TagToolbar(...) attribute (hovering, recommended) Razor @Edit.Toolbar(...) (non-hovering) Token Toolbars (using simpler placeholder templates) Core JavaScript Architecture Parts Commands This is what is executed when a button is clicked. Commands are things like edit. Some commands need additional parameters like EntityId, resulting in a command more like run('edit', {EntityId: 27}). Commands can also be run without toolbars, for example from edit links in tables etc. You can read more about Commands, incl. the full list of current command, parameters and how to create custom commands in the Commands section. Buttons This is a square thingy with an icon, which is will run a Command. When the button is created, it is fully configured with icon, commmand and command-parameters. Button-Group: This is a set of one or more -Buttons_ which are shown together. Often there will be a more button at one end of the set, which will show another button-group when clicked. Toolbar: This is a set of one or more Button-Groups. Toolbar Builder: This is an API-layer which builds the HTML for the Toolbar. Toolbar Bootstrapper: This will pick up HTML placeholders for toolbars and run the Toolbar Builder for these.

In this version we also changed the CSS functionality to not use the sc-element attribute, but still support it for backward compatibility."

    "keywords": "Image Resizer you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .image-resizer { visibility: visible; } 2sxc has an awesome Image Resizer built in. It's really easy to use - just add url parameters to the image. So instead of img.jpg add img.jpg?w=200 to resize it to 200px width. How to Use You can learn about the url parameters in the Image Resizer URL Parameters But normally you won't use them directly, because it's better to use APIs which will set these parameters for you. Your best options are: The IImageService with .Img(...) or .Picture(...) which will create the best possible HTML for you The Link.Image(...) which will create the best possible URL for you In most scenarios you will prefer the IImageService. In cases where you need exactly 1 url (like in background-url CSS) you will probably use the Link.Image(...). How it Works Tip This is just additional info in case you run into problems and need to dig deeper. The image resizer is built into 2sxc 13+ and uses the amazing ImageFlow library (previously ImageResizer.net). It's installed automatically by 2sxc but it can also be installed standalone (Dnn / Oqtane). ImageFlow Setup in DNN In DNN the DLLs are located in: [root]/bin/ToSic.Imageflow.Dnn.dll [root]/bin/Imageflow.Net.dll [root]/bin/Imazen.Common.dll [root]/bin/Imazen.HybridCache.dll [root]/bin/Newtonsoft.Json.dll - ATM part of DNN, but also used by ImageFlow in current version [root]/bin/System.Text.Json.dll - ATM part of 2sxc, and not used by ImageFlow, but will be used in future versions [root]/bin/ImageFlow/*.dll - ca. 12 Microsoft DLLs with specific versions for ImageFlow They are located in this folder as they would sometimes create version conflicts with other DLLs in DNN The web.config must be updated, which happens automatically. It will: enable url-handling of image files (eg. .jpg should be handled) register all the Microsoft DLLs in the ImageFlow folder so they are available for exactly this version The web.config changes

(or .net8.0 for Oqtane 5) for production it's in [root]/ (the main folder of Oqtane) Oqtane does not need web.config changes. The URL handling is activated using the IServerStartup interface as seen in this code. Troubleshooting Usually the image resizer just works, but if you run into problems, here are some tips. New Servers: Make sure Visual C++ Redistributable is Installed The Imageflow library is built with a mixture of Rust and C and requires the Visual C++ runtime to run. These runtime libraries are usually pre-installed, as they are a common dependency for a lot of software. However, they are missing on newer Windows Server Core, so this is a common issue. Microsoft docs Direct Download VC 16 Redistributables First: Make Sure ImageFlow is Used To start you may need to find out if ImageFlow is used at all, or if something else is handling the images. check if there is something else that could handle images registered in the web.config it's quite common to still have some ImageResizer.net entries there check if you have a folder for the cached images and if it gets new files as you try different resize combinations (eg ?w=1000 v ?w=1001) in DNN / Oqtane check the folder [root]/App_Data/imageflow_hybrid_cache an indication we found is to check the response headers with F12 loading an image - we found the following difference we believe that if ImageFlow is used, it seems to return an ETAG header without quotes, eg: ETAG: ybLeicE_NA97ZbYIyeURwOcFAn77bg45utBbtzOzgB0 we believe that IIS returns an ETAG with quotes eg. ETAG: \"54fa36c88844d41:0\" Also check your log files. If you believe that ImageFlow isn't being used, the try to fix that first. Suggestions: install ImageFlow by itself from the git repos (Dnn / Oqtane) compare a brand new system with 2sxc which it works with the broken setup History Introduced in 2sxc 5.03 Special Razor API to create links called Link.Image introduced in 12.04 Introduced ImageFlow in v12 for Oqtane Switched to ImageFlow in 13.0 for both Dnn and Oqtane Introducing IImageService in 13.05 beta, released in 13.10 Improved docs for DLLs etc. 2023-10 Shortlink: https://go.2sxc.org/resize"

    "keywords": "Images Guide (Best Practices & Code) you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .image-resizer { visibility: visible; } Images are a crucial part of every website and CMS. We want to be sure that: Perfect Editing Editors can easily add images Editors can give titles to images Editors can have some control over how the image is shown - but not too much, it must be within the restrictions of the design Perfect Output Images look great no matter what the editor does Images are accessible (for people with disabilities, etc.) Images use the latest possible file formats Images load quickly - which also requires images to be the best-possible size Perfect SEO & Page Speed Images are optimized for search engines Images are optimized for page speed, especially mobile page speed Pefect Control by the Designer The designer determines how images should look in various scenarios Tip This guide should help you understand the big <picture> 😏. Best read this while looking at the Tutorial For every detail there is much more technical documentation, which will be linked here. Part 1: Edit UI / UX The Edit UI presents various options to the user for uploading and configuring images. It's important to note that v13.10+ has a new feature to let the user customize what part of the image is really important (what corner/edge). This is important in scenarios where a resize would otherwise always show the middle, which may not be appropriate. Since this feature will only affect the output if the Razor template uses the IImageService, the designer must activate it on the field. Otherwise the feature is not available. Important: The config-button is only available... ...IF it has been enabled ...and IF the file is an image ...and IF the file \"belongs\" to the item being edited If the file is a general file from another item or from the root folder, the metadata is not available. This is important because files from elsewhere could be shared, and editing the metadata could have unexpected side-effects. Part 2: Image Metadata When a user edits the image settings in the UI, the data is stored as metadata for this image. This is important, because generating a perfect <img> or <picture> tag requires this information. Part 3: Dynamic Field If a content item stores the image on a property .Image then something like Content.Image would return /Portal/0/Adam/some-image.jpg. In this case, the IImageService cannot find the metadata. This is why we need to give it the entire field, not just the value. This is done using Content.Field(\"Image\") and will get your code a IDynamicField. Part 4: ImageService The IImageService will take all the known information and generate an <img> or a <picture> tag. This can be used in its default implementation just using .Img(Content.Field) or .Picture(...). In this case is uses the default Content settings (see below). If you need more control, there are 3 options: The Img(...) command has many more parameters for common scenarios such as using other settings, factor, imgAlt or imgClass You can also generate very custom settings using the .Settings(...) command on the ImageService You can also take the resulting object like var img = imgSvc.Img(Content.Image) and use it to generate the final tag yourself. Some Tutorials to learn this ImageService Img Tutorial ImageService Picture Tutorial ImageService Guide Part 5: Settings and Recipes Settings are preconfigured parameters how the image is to be resized. They are stored at App, Site, Global or Preset level. By default the configuration called Content is used for images in the Content of the page. Other settings also exist, such as Lightbox or Screen. You can also create your own configurations, such as PersonProfile. 👉🏼 Read more about Image Settings In your Razor code you can create new settings or modify existing ones using the .Setting(...) command on the ImageService. To create settings based on the Content use .Setting(\"Content\", ...) To create brand new settings, use .Setting(false, ...) Recipes define what variants of the image should be generated for other sizes, as well as other parameters to use when generating img or picture tags. The initial configuration is also stored in the settings and will be used, unless you specify something different. 👉🏼 Read more about Image Recipes You can also generate your own recipes: create a new recipe like this: .Recipe(\"2x, 3x\") - this is only meant to create a quick recipe with a few variants. inherit/expand an existing recipe like this: .Recipe(originalRecipe, ...) Part 6: Link.Image(...) API In the rare cases where you just need a URL and not the full HTML, check out the Link.Image(...) API. It is not as powerful as the ImageService but if you only need a URL it may be what you need. 🎓 Image Resizer Parameters with Link.Image History Guide created for v13.10"

Patrons Only Feature This is a patrons only feature. To use this feature, need the license [Patrons Advanced CMS](xref:2sxc Auto-Translate Overview). See activation instructions. Auto Translate uses Google Translate Auto Translate uses the Google Translate API. It is available in the Edit UI. This way the editor can run auto-translate, optimize the results and save. This requires a Google API key for each site. Auto Translate User Experience The user can choose to auto-translate a single field or all fields. After this, the user must select what source language should be used. The UI will show you how many fields of the available source languages have content. In the end you'll get the result for further editing. HTML and Unknown Content are Preserved Google Translate will preserve anything it can't translate - such as names (if it can tell it's a name) as well as HTML formatting. Not all Fields are Auto-Translated Some fields are not auto-translated - either by default, or by configuration. Some fields will not be translated by default Fields which can't be translated - such as entity-pickers Fields which don't make sense to translate - eg. Numbers, Links, GPS coordinates Some fields are configured to not translate this can be configured at the field level Name fields should be configured to not translate Address fields (street, city, etc.) should be configured to not translate Some fields were already translated manually, and will not auto-translate this is to prevent manual translations from being overwritten Fields which are not auto-translated will keep their previous status - in most cases locked (auto-inherit). To configure a field to not auto-translate, you can do this here: FAQ Q: Is it possible to just auto-translate at runtime?

As such, there are different parts that make it work: Multi language principles and data model Manual Content localization / translation / internationalization (i18n) Automatic Content translation (new in v15) Translation Permissions TODO: DOCS UI localization Multi-Language Principles The internal EAV Data Model stores each value with language assignment. Key facts: There is always a primary language which is set by the platform (DNN/Oqtane). The primary language must always be filled first. Other languages cannot be edited without the primary language having content. Other languages will inherit the values from the primary language by default. Changing the primary language can have suprising side-effects, because it can result in scenarios where the primary language is missing. In such scenarios the system will still try the primary language, but if it's empty, will fall back to the first language having any content for a specific field. Values can be for a single language only, or shared across languages In read/write shares, any change made in the value will automatically apply to all languages that use this value In read-only shares, the value can only be edited in the main language; all other languages just \"inherit\" the value In secondary languages which are not translated, they are not translated and will automatically fall back to the primary language 👉🏽 Read more about the Multilanguage Data Model Edit-UI Translation Features The Edit-UI can make a field editable in certain languages and not in others. These are the factors that control it: Data is missing in the primary language (then translating it isn't possible yet) Some data is not multi-languages so it's either not editable in other languages, or the changes automatically affect all languages. This specifically affects these two cases: Related items (which are the same across languages) Asset-files (which are the same across languages) Field-Configuration disables translation of field (common in url-id-fields) Export-Import of Multi-Language Content This is documented in Data Export / Import. Manual Content Translation Editors can always unlock any field (or all fields) to manually translate them. In that case it will copy the original value from the primary language. Users can also link languages together. This is ideal in scenarios where multiple secondary languages are closely related, such as de-DE and de-CH. TODO: SCREENSHOTS?

System Fingerprint To understand how the license ties to your installation, you should first know about the fingerprint. Every system has a digital fingerprint which consists of platform name (Dnn/Oqtane), platform version, 2sxc version and more. Every system has a generated fingerprint. It will stay the same until you do a major upgrade of the platform or 2sxc, or if you migrate the system. Enterprise scenarios with many installations can also add a custom fingerprint in addition to the default fingerprint. This allows web companies to auto-enable certain licenses across all installations. Custom fingerprints are provided by the makers of 2sxc and stored as json files in the global App_Data/system-custom new in v15 Registration Every system which wishes to use advanced features (free or paid) must be registered on 2sxc Patrons. There are two types of users on 2sxc Patrons: If you have a GitHub Login you can use it to log on If you need an enterprise login or just don't have a GitHub login, you can log on using a normal DNN user in Patrons Registration can be automatic or manual, depending on your needs. The automatic registration can be triggered from inside your 2sxc installation. Manual registration requires you to copy/paste your fingerprint from your 2sxc to Patrons. License Selection Once a system is registered on 2sxc Patrons, you can select what licenses you want to enabled for that system. If you don't support 2sxc you can activate free licenses If you are a Github-Sponsors patron then you can activate as many features as your contribution allows If you are an Enterprise patron then you can activate the features based on the contract with the makers of 2sxc. Advanced Licenses for Patrons To activate advanced licenses/features, you have two options: Become a GitHub Patron - this is only available for GitHub logins Reach out to makers of 2sxc to get a custom license and an official bill. This works for both GitHub logins as well as enterprise logins. You can now activate additional licenses based on your contribution and/or enterprise agreement. License Activation The license file is a JSON file containing the activated licenses, the fingerprint and a digital signature. This file must be transferred to your system to work. The transfer can happen automatically or manually, depending on your needs. Note that all licenses will be stored as *.license.json in this folder: [website-root]/DesktopModules/ToSIC_SexyContent/App_Data/system-custom/configurations/ Automatic Activation When you activate the license automatically you just have to click this button: For this to work, the web server must be able to access the internet. The license will be downloaded and stored in [license-folder]/default.license.json. Manual Activation Manual activation is useful when the web server is not able to connect to the internet. In that scenario, you can download the license file directly from Patrons and upload it using Upload License button. Note that the manual license download has a different name than the default one. This is by design, because 2sxc can use multiple licenses files. Just remember that a future auto-download will not replace the manual file. Multiple Licenses The licensing system allows multiple licenses to be activated. This is useful in scenarios where you have an enterprise license on all systems to activate some features (maybe Patron Infrastructure) and a system-specific license to add more features (like Patron Sentinel). For this, all the licenses must be located in the license folder.

The reason is that a license file was installed for a previous version of 2sxc, and must be upgraded to the new version. Background 2sxc uses licenses to activate special features. These licenses are usually system-bound, meaning that they are activated for a specific system. This is done by generating a fingerprint of the system, and then activating the license for that fingerprint. Since 2sxc does not communicate with the license server, it cannot know if the license is valid for the current system. So it uses a security hash which also contains the major version of 2sxc, requiring you to upgrade the license when you upgrade 2sxc. 📖 Read more about it in Licenses in 2sxc How to Fix Just re-register your system using patrons. Exact Warning Messages These are included in case users google this exact message: The text in v15 is: Warning: Registration is Invalid. Some features may be disabled because of this.

In 2sxc/EAV we talk about Metadata being Data which has a Target that it applies to. The 2sxc-EAV system has had extensive Metadata functionality built in since v2 but we haven't talked about it much yet. Example: File Metadata Imagine you have a file system containing images and the file system has standard functionality to store data like file name, path, file size and created / modified. Sometimes we need more. Let's assume you wanted to show a gallery with images and you want to manage additional information like Tags and a short Description. In this scenario the File is the Target and the additional Tags/Description data is the Metadata. Example: User Metadata Let's say you have a system which stores basic user data like UserId, UserName and Password and you want to manage additional information like Biography. IF the platform (Dnn) already offers features to manage such additional info, it is not Metadata. But if the information is added on top like with a third-party system (like 2sxc) then this is Metadata. How 2sxc/EAV uses Metadata Most internal configuration of 2sxc works as Metadata. Fields on a Content-Type is stored as just the technical Name (which is used in code). Any additional information for the Edit-UI like description, default-value, etc. is stored as Metadata. Content-Types just have some internal IDs and names. Any additional information like description, icon, help-text etc. is stored as Metadata. App Configuration is treated as Metadata and most of the stored values are available on the App object Various Apps like the Fancybox Gallery App allow the editor to add more information to uploaded images How 2sxc Metadata Works Every Entity in 2sxc can be assigned to any other Target data. This happens through a Target Identifier which consists of 2 parts: The Target ID which can be a number, guid or string The Target Type which is important to ensure that an ID like 5027 is pointing to the person 5027, not the page 5027 Noteworthy to know most entities don't have Target Identifiers so most of the data is not Metadata assigning an entity to a target can only be done when the Entity is created and not later on In the data-lists of the Admin-UI you can see if an item is Metadata - it will have a tag-icon in the ID column Discover More Create Metadata - (advanced ⚠) Read / Access Metadata - (advanced ⚠) Metadata Target Types ToSic.Eav.Metadata Demo App and further links Fancybox Gallery App History Introduced in 2sxc v2 Continuously improved in 2sxc 7, 8, 10 and 11 Shortlink: https://go.2sxc.org/metadata"

    "keywords": "Permissions in 2sxc 2sxc permissions are interlinked with the users and roles of the platform (Dnn or Oqtane). So if Dnn or Oqtane say a user may do something, 2sxc will follow that. But there is more to it. Many situations require some control which the platform doesn't offer. Here are some examples: Admins in DNN are often just content-editors, and shouldn't be able to reconfigure 2sxc Headles APIs (REST) needs permissions which you cannot set in the platfrom Custom APIs (C# Controllers) need permissions which are not platform-configurable This section will help you understand how permissions work and where to configure them. Platform Permissions System Admins aka Super Users (SystemAdmin) A super-user (host-user) has full permissions on everything. There is no way to change this. This means that super users can install, configure, query, edit and delete everything. In C# you can always detect this on the CmsContext.User.IsSystemAdmin Site Admins (SiteAdmin) Admin users have full permissions on a specific site (Dnn: portal). So by default they can do everything which only affects the current site. If you have special Roles such as 2sxcAdministrators then this can behave differently. In C# you can always detect this on the CmsContext.User.IsSiteAdmin Content Admins (ContentAdmin) Many admins are just configured as admins to allow them to edit everything. So often the status Administrator is only given because it's the only real way to ensure the user can change every page, without wanting to allow the user to edit other users or reconfigure the site. Because of this, we have the concept of ContentAdmins The platforms Dnn and Oqtane currently don't offer a pure content-admin role. Because of this, 2sxc allows us to do this in another way. If the site/portal has a role called 2sxcAdministrators (previously 2sxc Designers) then all administrators will be treated as ContentAdmins with less permissions. Any administrator which is then in this role 2sxcAdministrators will have higher rights. For further details, see role 2sxcAdministrators In C# you can always detect this on the CmsContext.User.IsContentAdmin Edit Permissions The platform Dnn/Oqtane can give users Edit permissions. On both platforms this can be assigned at the page as well as the module permission. Users with edit permissions will be able to edit content or change what layout is used, but not be able to access advanced admin features. App Permissions For special use cases you may want to give users permissions in a specific App. For example, a Classifieds App or a Comments App could allow registered users to add their own posts and also edit them. Warning Be careful with such permissions, as you don't want to open up your entire App. Normally you will only want to assign permissions to a specific Content Type. Content-Type Edit Permissions These permissions can be configured at the Content-Type level. A typical example would be Registered Users can create a new Comment Registered Users can read the schema of Comment so the edit-UI can be accessed Registered Users can edit Comments which they own/created Tip Just because the permissions allow editing doesn't mean the UI will automatically show toolbars. This is because you may have special buttons or My Comments page or something to do this. So don't forget to ensure the UI is available as you want it. REST API Permissions (Headless) To use data on the REST API you must also determine what is allowed. You can configure this at the App Content-Type level. WebApi Controller Permissions When you create custom WebApi controllers, you will have to use C# attributes to configure permissions. Please check the examples, ATM we don't have time to document the details. Polymorph Editions The System Admin can also review new code on the live system without affecting other users. This feature is called Polymorphism. It is only available to SystemAdmins.

    "keywords": "Polymorphism aka Open-Heart-Surgery Tip The key concept behind Polymorphism is having the same template and code in various editions (morphs) which are automatically used based on certain rules. Polymorphism Addresses 3 Problems #1 Workin on Live Sites aka Open-Heart-Surgery Imagine you have a running system and you want to make some changes on the live installation. During the time you work, you would always risk breaking the site, but we usually don't have the time to create a staging environment. #2 Creating Templates that work with Multiple CSS-Frameworks When the same design must work in various CSS-Frameworks, you actually need different templates for each - and switching between them must be automatic. #3 A/B Testing In marketing, we want to test various design with different audiences and measure what works best. Polymorph Folder Structure Let's compare the perfect multi-edition (polymorph) setup to the classic solution: Note Automatic View-Polymorphism replaces the manual approach for CSS-Framework and common Open-Heart-Surgery scenarios. The manual approach is still recommended for complex polymorphism as well as A/B Testing. View Polymorphism Automatic View Polymorphism based on CSS-Framework The system is fairly easy to understand. So if polymorphism is activated for CSS-Framework detection, here are the rules: The default template file is the one configured in the view configuration 2sxc will try to find file with the matching name in 2 locations using the name of css framework published by the skin in the koi.json beneath the current folder in the app root folder If nothing is found, the default template file is used If a match is found, it will load that. Note that if the theme does not have a koi.json, the code used is unk for unknown. Here's a checklist how start using View Polymorphism with CSS-Frameworks: Automatic View Polymorphism based on SuperUser Permissions This is meant for Open-Heart-Surgery - so you can work on templates on a live site without breaking the output for normal users. This is how it works (if you have turned it on): The default template is the one configured in the view configuration 2sxc will try to find a file with matching name in either the [root]/staging (for super users) or [root]/live (for normal users) If it is found, 2sxc will render that template Otherwise the default template is used Here's a checklist to get started: Manual View Polymorphs In case the automatic setup doesn't suit your needs, you can do it manually like this: Razor Guide to View Polymorphism Tip These are just a few hints for you as you work with it. Don't forget to activate it in the settings If the Razor code ever wants to know what edition (morph) it's in, check the CmsContext.View.Edition property. You would do this for things like If you need a JS or CSS from the same folder If you need to link to a WebApi of the same edition WebAPI Polymorphims Api Controllers are already fully polymorph. They can be placed in a subfolder like [app-root]/live/api/WtfController.cs and can be accessed using a url with the edition in the name, allowing multiple identically named controllers to be used. Views are polymorph if you do the view selection manually. This means, you can place your views in a subfolder like [app-root]/live/list.cshtml and then have an entry-point [app-root]/list.cshtml which will choose which edition to use - then using @RenderPage to pick that edition. This is still manual, because we're not sure yet what the perfect implementation is, so we would rather wait before standardizing a bad solution. Everything that is data (schemas, items, queries, settings and resources) is still one edition only. The data model is able to perform multi-edition content-management, but we're not ready yet to provide the UIs etc. for this, as it could lead to confusion, so we'll hold back on this for now. How to use WebApi Polymorph As of now, to use the WebApi Polymorp, this is what you would do: instead of placing your WtfController.cs in the [app-root]/api/ folder, you place it in a [app-root]/live/api folder. the live, default JS would then access it using [dnn-api-root]/app/auto/live/api/Wtf You can then copy this controller to [app-root]/dev/api and make your changes there. In your JS, you would then (while testing/developing) access this edition using [dnn-api-root]/app/auto/dev/api/Wtf without causing problems on the live solution, as all other users are still accessing the live edition, while you're working on the dev edition. Once everything works, deploy (copy) the now modified WtfController.cs from the dev/api folder to live/api and all users benefit from the changes. Data Polymorphism Data Polymorphism has not been implemented yet. The idea would be that changes to data or even schemas (fields of a type) would be staged as we work. For now, Data-Polymorphism is low priority, because we're not sure yet if we can \"pull this off\" in a way that won't confuse the users.

No Preparation Two cases need no preparation at all Templates / code which don't use any data Templates / code which use only general App data or Queries but not instance data In these cases the View is configured to not use data and the template or WebApi will either not use data or will only access it through the App.Data which has all data at it's disposal.

Internally it uses a Query which looks like this: This does the following (starting from the bottom): The ICache is an IAppRoot DataSource which hass all data of this App The PublishingFilter will then ensure that editors can see draft-data, and public users can only see published data The ModuleDataSource is a CmsBlock which will select all relevant data of this Module instance It then provides the retrieved data on a Stream Default (all the items) and Header (previously ListContent) The Template or WebApi running for this Module Instance will then have this data Content or often @Content has the first item on the Default stream Header or ofter @Header has the first and only item on the ListContent stream Data will contain all the streams as configured in the above query, usually you will use Data[\"Default\"] to loop through lists of all the content items Note that the ModuleDataSource also does some more magic like Retrieve the Demo-Item as configured in the View, if no data exists (or a public user is looking at the page, and the data is still draft) Add more information like IsDemoItem to each piece of Information The Content App only has this kind of preparation. Customs Apps can also use this, but it can also be configured to use custom Queries (see below). Query Preparation If your View is configured to use a Query it will instead run this query. Note Note that your query can also extend the standard Query as mentioned above and provide both the normal edited content and add more streams as needed. Tip A common use case for Queries extending the default query is scenarios where the edited content provides parameters for the Query. For example, the Header of the News App could contain a property Category which the editor can choose. The rest of the Query could then use this category to filter what items are retrieved. Note about Accessing all App Data in your Code Your template / WebAPI can also always access all the data in the App using App.Data.

If it's configurable you'll see a button appear when you mouse over it like this: The dialog which appears will be different for each type of DataSource. In the C# code of the DataSource, these parameters are available as Settings. Configuration can be Values or Tokens Almost all configuration values are strings, even if the DataSource expects a number. This allows you to write either 27 or [QueryString:Id] depending on your needs. Here's an example: Queries can be parameterized with token placeholders like [QueryString:Id] [App:Settings:PageSize] [Params:Sort] To understand these placeholder tokens, best read up on LookUp Tokens Explained. There you'll read about how tokens work, where they come from, how to use default/fallback values and more. Aside from the normal LookUps like QueryString, User etc. there are two special LookUps which you should know about: Params and In. Global Query Parameters with Params-Token Each Query can have a list of Parameters which all parts can access through the Params LookUp. This has some great benefits: A developer can always see what parameters affect the Query If you use the same parameter in various places, you can be sure that it's always the same value. These Parameters can also be set from another query calling it This is what it looks like in VisualQuery: You will find a full explanation of this here: Params LookUp in Query Parameters. Tip You can write the tokens you need like [QueryString:Id] directly into any DataSource configuration. But we highly recommend that you create a param for it and use that instead. It just makes it easier for people looking at your query to see what will affect its results. Get Configuration from Another DataSource Often some stored data will be used to change what a DataSource does. Here's an example which will retrieve a Category either pre-defined or from the URL, then use that category to apply a filter: Here's how the settings of that are configured: Read more about the In LookUp.

    "keywords": "VisualQuery: In Streams you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .query-app { visibility: visible; } DataSources often have In Streams. Some are required and some are optional. There are three common cases: No In-Streams because the DataSource generates data (eg. the Sql DataSource) In-Streams which supply data for processing In-Streams which simply supply configuration The counterpart of In-Streams are Out-Streams. This is what In-Streams look like in VisualQuery: The Three Common Cases Case 1: DataSources without In-Streams Root DataSources generate or get data, and don't need an In-Stream. Here's an example from a CSV DataSource. Case 2: In-Streams for Data Processing This is a most common case, where a datasource gets one or more streams, and filter or modify the content. Here's an example of the StreamPick DataSource which has 3 inbound streams, and picks the one called Default to pass on: Case 3: In-Streams for Configuration In addition to data providing In-Streams, a DataSource may also use the data from an In to get a setting. In these cases the first item in the stream can be used as a parameter in the Settings using In-Lookups like [In:Module:Category]. Read more about In-LookUps. In-Stream Names The names on an In-Stream are important since they affect how the stream is used. Note that the names must be unique. This is case-insensitive, so Default and default are regarded as the same name and wouldn't be valid. Pre-Named In-Streams If the DataSource has special In-Streams which have a pre-defined purpose they are pre-named. This example of the ValueFilter DataSource can run a filter on Default, and if it ends up empty, can deliver a Fallback stream: The Country filter - it didn't find anything in the Default for the filter, so it receives 11 items and forwards 11 items from the Fallback Test data for Country is blank The Industry filter - it did find something, so it only forwards the 2 matching items Test data for the Industry expects Web Dynamic In-Streams Some DataSources can handle an infine amount of In-Streams like the StreamPick DataSource. This is indicated by the orange 🔺 on mouse-over: This means you can connect as many In-Streams as you want. Just make sure the names are unique. Rename In-Streams You can always rename a connection by clicking on the name and typing in a new name. Required vs. Optional In-Streams Some streams are optional, some are required. In the example of the ValueFilter above, the Default is required, and the Fallback is optional. In-Streams Cannot be Re-Used An Out-Stream can be connected to multiple In-Streams but the opposite is not possible. So an In can only have one source, but an Out can give it's data to multiple In sources. Nice to Know By convention, the default In-stream is called Default In-Streams have data which can be used, but they are not accessed until you really need them History Introduced ca. in 2sxc 6 Dynamic-In has existed since 2sxc 6 but the visual queue was added in 2sxc 11.13"

By convention, the primary Out is called Default. Such a Stream will contain zero, one or many Entities (items of data) depending on the logic in the DataSource and the data/configuration which was handed in. The counterpart of Out-Streams are In-Streams. Out Streams in VisualQuery These are predefined Out Streams where each DataSource declares what it can offer: Some Sources can have Dynamic Out where you can create as many Out streams as you want. Usually the name you give each stream will affect what is in it: Rename Out-Streams You can always rename a connection by clicking on the name and typing in a new name. Out-Streams are Run Once If an Out-Stream is accessed in a web-request it will run the code to create the Stream. If it is accessed again (re-used) within the same request, it will simply return the data from the first run. Out-Streams are Lazy An Out-Stream offers Data, but the underlying code is not executed unless accessed. This is for performance reasons. For an Out-Stream to be accessed, it must be connected to one or more In-Stream of other DataSource which in turn are accessed. Note that when debugging in VisualQuery, all Out-Streams of the final target are accessed to show statistis, but if the Query is used elsewhere very often not all streams are accessed. Unused Out-Streams If an out-stream is not connected to anything, it's not used and the underlying code which generates this data will not be accessed. Out-Streams can be Reused An Out-Stream can be connected to multiple In-Streams but the opposite is not possible.

The Designer This is what it looks like: This is what you see when you run a query: Add Parts / DataSources Just add parts to your query as you need them: ...and drag them around for positioning as you want: Connect Parts / DataSources Now just connect Out Streams of some parts to the In Streams on other parts: In some cases, the connection to drop unto already has the right name, otherwise just click on the name to rename it: Tip Renaming connections can be very important, as the receiver of data may expect a specifically named In Stream to bring it data. The most common name is Default BTW. You can also rename the Outbound connection if you want this: Tip Just like the In-Streams, the Out-Streams names can have an important effect. In the example above, renaming the Out means that the shown App DataSource will only give data of the type Company on this stream. Save, Run and Debug Here's an example of the result after running the query shown above: As you can see, the designer shows each connection and how much data was in it (and you'll see a dialog showing the data). If we click on a stream we can also see exactly what was in the stream: Read more about this in VisualQuery 3: Debugging. Add more DataSources and Connect To build your dream-query, add more parts as you need them... As you can see, the resulting stream has 0 items in it.

    "keywords": "Optimizing Template Assets / Client Dependencies (JS & CSS) you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .asset-optimizer { visibility: visible; } Learn about using the Dnn Client-Resource-Management aka Dnn Client-Depedency-Management in 2sxc templates. Whenever a template needs additional files, specifically JavaScripts CSS Styles Image Resources Fonts These should be included in an optimized form to enhance performance dramatically. This is all about reducing the amount of server requests (very important for end-user performance) and delivering them in the order / places in the HTML-file, optimal for their purpose. So far 2sxc will take care of your JS/CSS files by bundling and minifying them, at the position and order you need. How to use Here's a trivial example for optimizing a CSS with default settings: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"@App.Path/style.css\" @Kit.Page.AssetAttributes() /> This will Create a link to the file styles.css in the current App Add some attributes which will enable optimizations If you have Content Security Policy (CSP) enabled, it will also whitelist the resources in CSP Here's a more typical example, showing an optimization for a style & js which are inside the app-folder. This example uses Razor, so we use @App.Path to ensure it's picking up the right folder (use [App:Path] in token-templates): <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"@App.Path/assets/style.css\" @Kit.Page.AssetAttributes(priority: 150) /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"@App.Path/assets/lazy.css\" @Kit.Page.AssetAttributes(position: \"bottom\") /> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"@App.Path/assets/scripts.js\" @Kit.Page.AssetAttributes(priority: 200, position: \"bottom\") /> </script> This shows: a CSS with lower priority (150 instead of the default 100) a css with which will be placed at the page bottom (so it will load later) a script-tag and specifies priority and placement inside the HTML document How it works Basically all <script> tags and all <link rel=\"stylesheet\"> tags can have a special attribute, which the system will parse according to the environments capabilities. In Dnn 7/8/9 this means it can can assign priorities (to ensure load-order) can assign placement in the html-document (head, body, bottom) Understanding Priorities There is a fairly complicated article in the dnn wiki about client resource management which explains most of it. In general you can say that all Dnn scripts load with priorities below 100, the default for all standard scripts is 100, and from there you can order things as you need them. We usually prioritize libraries like 2sxc or angular.min.js with 100 or larger, and then place our own script (like an app-blog.min.js) at numbers like 200. Understanding Placement Placement information can only be supplied in 2sxc 8.9 or higher. The three positions are: head meaning that the resulting data is requested in the HTML header. So it will be loaded before the page is rendered, meaning it's available right from the start but also delays page-build. This is often detrimental in terms of page-load times. this is the default location for CSS files body meaning it will be loaded in the beginning of the HTML body tag. Again this means it's there very early, but will slow down page buildup. this is the default location for JS files bottom meaning it will be loaded at the end of the html document. This is actually great for page-loading performance to improve above-the-fold loading. But it takes a bit of work to perfect its application.

    "keywords": "App State you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .data-data { visibility: visible; } The EAV caches everything in memory, to ensure that everything is super-fast and doesn't require lazy loading. This is because lazy-loading has a dangerous tendancy to ping-pong a lot of requests if the code isn't very optimized - and caching everything solves that problem. Tip Before you start: Remember that you usually don't need this if you are creating Razor templates or WebApi - for that, you want to read Dynamic Entity Objects. Once an app is accessed by code, a sophisticated internal system loads everything into the app-state which is then cached. Everything then uses this data, and save-operations usually do a partial update of the cache. This is one of the things that makes 2sxc and the EAV so amazingly fast. Usually you don't care much about the app-state, since you simply use the data provided by the current context. If you want to know more, check out the ToSic.Eav.Apps.AppState.

    "keywords": "How Data Flows in the Server you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .process-all { visibility: visible; } 2sxc is simple to use, but to enable that, it's pretty sophisticated on the inside. Let's take a look at how data is accessed, cached, queried, maybe cached again, and provided to the output. Note All the data handling systems come from the EAV. This is then enhanced and customized by Sxc and Sxc.Dnn. Core Paradigms Rule #1: Data is Reactive As you'll soon see, the EAV performs a lot of automatic lookup and caching, but as a first rule, this happens Reactively, only when data is actually accessed. This is similar to how ReactiveX or NgRx work, just much simpler. Rule #2: Data is Read-Only Any data the code receives as IEntity objects is read-only. This allows for a much more robust data model and API which in a CMS environment is usually 99% read, 1% write. Rule #3: Data Always Comes from DataSources Inside the system everything is loosely coupled (think Depedency Injection). So anything requesting data will always use a DataSource provided by some magic, and then use what was given. Rule #4: Data is Managed and Cached per App Once data from an App was requested, the entire app is loaded and cached. Within an app a lot of data can be linked together using Content-Types, Relationships, Sub-Lists, Metadata and more. If we would lazy-load this on-demand from the storage system (SQL), it would result in a ping-pong of requests, which would be very inefficient. This unit of cache is called an AppState. Overall Flow When Creating Html Imagine that your custom Razor template in a Dnn module is initialized. Here's what happens: 1. Preparation 2sxc starts with the ModuleId as it's inside a Dnn Module. It will then create a Block for this InstanceId (which is the ModuleId). The Block internally will create a CmsBlock DataSource, pass in the InstanceId and then wait for data to pour in. The CmsBlock knows about Dnn, and will use the InstanceId to get the ModuleSettings in Dnn. This contains only 2 pieces of information: the AppId which it is visualizing, and a ContentBlockId which is the full configuration of the Content-Block which will be shown. The CmsBlock also knows if the user is an editor (which would result in draft-items being included). The CmsBlock DataSource will then ask the underlying EAV for this block configuration (stored as an Entity) which is then loaded from the Cache. When the configuration is found, the CmsBlock then knows what View will be used. The CmsBlock itself is a DataSource and is now configured to deliver the data which the view expects. Note The CmsBlock doesn't know about the internals of the cache, it just asks for it. The cache will auto-initialize the AppState if it hasn't been accessed before. Note The CmsBlock will also not load any data yet. It just knows what would be loaded, should it ever be accessed. Tip When you use views which don't have a content-type configured, then properties like Data, Content or Header will be null. But App.Data will still work. 2. Execution The Block is now ready. 2sxc now consults the View to find out which Engine to use (Razor or Token). It will now load this engine, give it the Block and wait for the resulting Html to be created. The engine loads the template and lets it do what it should. If the template has code accessing Data then the underlying source will retrieve the necessary data. If it's a normal content-view, then the items provided will be the ones which an editor has manually added, since they were referenced in the ContentBlock. If the view relies on a Query, then this query is built and will be waiting to execute if the data is accessed. If the code accesses App.Data then this data source will build up everything necessary so it just works. If the code accesses App.Query then the underlying system will prepare the Query as needed. Note All the data retrieving features like Data do not actually retrieve any data unless accessed. This also means that Content or Header won't use any CPU cycles unless accessed. The same goes for App.Data - nothing is processed unless it's accessed. Note The queries are only provided by the App for immediate use. They won't be built or executed unless they are actually read. Overall Flow when Creating WebAPIs This works just like the Html creation, except that we don't need an engine. The code which inherits from ApiController now works with the data as needed. The same lazy-execution rules apply: neither Data, Content, App.Data or App.Query use any CPU cycles, unless the data is actually pulled by reading it.

Background You'll often write code in your 2sxc Apps - either as C#/Razor or JavaScript. 2sxc is a very open system, so you can use any editor you like. For quick fixes and simple things, use the built-in editor, which is based on Monaco (VS Code Online). But for more sophisticated stuff we recommend VS Code. Prepare VS Code for 2sxc VSCode is amazing right out of the box, but to really be productive, you need to do a few things: Install VS Code Install the C# DevKit extensions Configure each App with Intellisense (see below) Ignore the obj and .vs folders (see below) Check possible edge cases (see below) With these preparations, VS-Code is able to assist in basic C# code. It can't provide IntelliSense for 2sxc specific APIs yet, so for that, read on. Configure an App for Razor IntelliSense Apps are usually opened as a folder in VS-Code. The problem for IntelliSense is that it doesn't know which DLLs it should use. So you need to tell it. This is done by adding a .sln solution file and a .csproj project file. Add the following two files to the root of your app: Template for the /app.sln file Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 12.00 # Visual Studio Version 17 VisualStudioVersion = 17.5.002.0 Project(\"{9A19103F-16F7-4668-BE54-9A1E7A4F7556}\") = \"App\", \"app.csproj\", \"{9F7A078F-99D5-4EF4-8EC0-C6B920FE679C}\" EndProject # # Visual Studio .sln File for 2sxc App # This is necessary so that VS Code can perform intellisense in Razor # It also requires a csproj file to exist as well # # Read more on https://go.2sxc.org/vscode # Template for the /app.csproj file <Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> <!-- This file helps VS Code provide IntelliSense - see https://go.2sxc.org/vscode --> <PropertyGroup> <TargetFramework>net4.7.2</TargetFramework> <RootNamespace>App</RootNamespace> </PropertyGroup> <ItemGroup> <!-- Tell Visual Studio & VSCode to respect all ToSic.* DLLs in the root bin folder --> <Reference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\bin\\ToSic.*.dll\" /> <!-- also add DotNetNuke DLLs - we don't recommend this, because then your code will never be hybrid --> <!-- <Reference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\bin\\DotNetNuke.dll\" /> <Reference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\bin\\DotNetNuke.*.dll\" /> --> </ItemGroup> <!-- Polymorphism If you're working with Polymorphism then you have many of the same files, which confuses Intellisense eg. - /live and /staging have the same files - /bs3 /bs4 / bs5 have the same files The following is meant to exclude some of these folders from intellisense --> <!-- Example: exclude /live as we're always working on /staging --> <ItemGroup> <None Remove=\"live\\**\" /> <Content Remove=\"live\\**\" /> <Compile Remove=\"live\\**\" /> <EmbeddedResource Remove=\"live\\**\" /> </ItemGroup> </Project> Tip Adding these files helps VSCode provide IntelliSense. But be aware that it can't help with dynamic code. To get the full benefit, use typed code. GitIgnore Temporary Folders Add these lines to your .gitignore file to prevent temporary files from being added to your repository: .vs/ obj/ Check for Edge Cases - DNN with .net 4.7.2 / 4.8 If you're using DNN with .net 4.7.2 or 4.8, you may have to do some extra work. We're still not 100% sure what this is, since our dev PCs are always setup with all kinds of build tools where it works. According to research by Accuraty you may need to follow the instructions as noted on the C# extension. The C# extension is auto-installed by the Dev-Kit, but there is this (quoted): Note Note: If working on a solution that requires versions prior to .NET 6 or non-solution based projects, install a .NET Framework runtime and MSBuild tooling. Set omnisharp.useModernNet to false and set dotnet.server.useOmnisharp to true Uninstall or disable C# Dev Kit we're not sure if this is correct any more! Windows: .NET Framework along with MSBuild Tools MacOS/Linux: Mono with MSBuild According to our current understanding you don't need to do this is you have Visual Studio 2022 installed. We assume that already includes all the bits which VS Code needs as well. We haven't been able to verify or simplify this, but if you're having trouble, do read the blog post by Accuraty as well.

    "keywords": "Wysiwyg - Guide This guide will help you understand how to use the Wysiwyg editor and output it in 2sxc. What is Wysiwyg? 2sxc has various fields and input types. String fields can have a WYSIWYG input type. When content is edited this way, it will be stored as a string containing HTML. Types of Wysiwyg As of v15.0x there are two core types of Wysiwyg content. The main difference is how the edit UI provides special features and adds styling to the content. Standard wysiwyg (the only option before v15) In standard mode the editor is limited in what he/she can do, and styling (eg. image size or alignment) is applied directly to the HTML as style attributes. Since the HTML contains everything, you simply have to output it as raw HTML. Use @Html.Raw(item.FieldName) to output it. Text wysiwyg (new v15) In text mode the editor is limited in what he/she can do, for example (WIP) they can't add images Since the HTML contains everything, you simply have to output it as raw HTML. Use @Html.Raw(item.FieldName) to output it. Rich wysiwyg (new in v15) In rich mode the editor can do more, and styling is applied as CSS classes. An important difference is that images are not inside p tags, but always outside of them. Since the HTML only specifies classes, these classes must be defined in your CSS to have an effect. Use @Cms.Show(item.Field(\"FieldName\")) to output it, which also ensures that the default CSS is added to the page. You can set more parameters on Show(...) for finer control. Note As we'll improve the features, the differences in the editor will become more apparent. We plan to also introduce lightweight Text modes which prevent image uploading and more. TODO: how to select these modes Rich Wysiwyg Classes The following should explain the various features in Rich mode so you have an idea of their purpose and how they are applied. When using the @Cms.Show(...) method, it will create a wrapper with a wysiwyg classes, so it will look ca. like this: ... <div class='wysiwyg-container'> ... <img class='wysiwyg-left wysiwyg-50' src='...'> <hr class='wysiwyg-splitter wysiwyg-spacer-s'> <img class='wysiwyg-right wysiwyg-33' src='...'> </div> Tip You can of course specify a different tag than div and also change other defaults. The CSS that is automatically added will do some magic: the main wysiwyg-container will receive a container-type of inline-size - see mdn docs Image Alignment todo Classes wysiwyg-left wysiwyg-right wysiwyg-center In the standard implementation, alignments apply to large, desktop/ipad-sized containers. This means that if final HTML is shown on a wide div, the alignments will be applied. However, if the final HTML is shown in a narrow div, the alignment will be ignored. Your skin or module CSS can override this behavior - see below. Image Size Sizes in rich mode are meant to be responsive, so they are not absolute pixel sizes, but relative sizes. The ratios like 33 (1 of 3) are what desktop users should see, and the built-in CSS will adjust the size for mobile devices. Classes wysiwyg-100 - full width wysiwyg-50 - half width wysiwyg-33 - 1/3 width wysiwyg-66 - 2/3 width wysiwyg-25 - 1/4 width wysiwyg-75 - 3/4 width In the standard implementation, alignments apply to large, desktop/ipad-sized containers. This means that if final HTML is shown on a wide div, the alignments will be applied. However, if the final HTML is shown in a narrow div, the alignment will be ignored. Splitters and Spacers Splitters break the page into sections, so that the content following a splitter is freshly aligned. This is important to ensure that aligned content doesn't get stacked, but starts anew below the previous content. Splitters are implemented as <hr> tags with special CSS classes (see below). Spacers are splitters with additional CSS classes which determine the height of the gap. This allows the editor to add standardized space between content.

Convert Dnn ☢️ and Oqtane 🩸 into a CMS 2sxc is a CMS- and Meta-Plugin for Dnn/DotNetNuke and Oqtane. It makes content editing easier than other CMSs like Wordpress, while giving the designer full control. It's also a CMF like Drupal. And a very cool EAV data-management system. And a headless REST API. And a lot more. 2sxc is used to provide web-site-builder functionality. It has a simple Content mode where users just add images, designed text/image blocks, links etc. Then there's the sophisticated App mode, where user add standalone functional apps like blogs, galleries and more. Most apps are on github and can be downloaded from the app-catalog. Where to Start 2sxc is an easy to use dynamic content system for .net Platforms like Dnn. If you are just getting started, then this is probably not where you should be looking. Focus first on: The Basics which tells you about Architecture, Data Models and more Content on 2sxc.org like the learn section Apps on 2sxc Catalog which contains many ready-to-use apps like blogs and news, as well as tutorials The Dnn Tutorials on 2sxc.org 👉 With this knowledge, you can already create amazing stuff. 2sxc is very flexible and can be used for almost any kind of content-management needs or app development needs. Because of this, different documentations help you work with different things. Here's the overview: A list of features, concepts and examples can be found in the Docs section of 2sxc.org, including things not specifically code related Many solutions and recommendations are found in the Blog on 2sxc.org Many demo, template and tutorial Apps are found in the App Catalog on 2sxc.org 2sxc / EAV Roadmap Pending Documentation Work Next to document Finish metadata documentation Create in the APIs (simplify APIs first) Create good sample of Page-Metadata App These topics are insufficiently documented...

Get the Sxc using $2sxc There are four get-signatures: With an HTML Tag: $2sxc(tag: HTMLElement) - recommended With a Module ID: $2sxc(moduleId: number) - oldest way, very common Using a Context: $2sxc(context: ContextIdentifier) - new in v11.11 $2sxc(moduleId, contentBlockId) - a special version for internal use only For demos it depends a bit on your scenario. Vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript Inline JavaScript - easiest to use External JavaScript External JavaScript with turnOn - recommended! 🚀 External JavaScript Framework such as Angular, Vue or React Get Sxc with Inline JavaScript This is the easiest to use, but we suggest you try to avoid it, because of CSP-Hardening. Get with an HTML Tag (Inline) We recommend the HTMLElement syntax. With this syntax, $2sxc will go up through the DOM-tree and find the module it's in (or the content-block). It will then auto-configure itself. What's nice about this is that this method works without any server-side support (which you need for the other methods). Here's a simple example: <a onclick='$2sxc(this).cms.run(\"layout\")'>layout</a> In the above example, the HTMLElement is given by the current click, which puts the current <a> node in the this object. Here's a JS example: var x = document.getElementById(\"myApp\"); // get a dom element inside this 2sxc app var sxc1 = $2sxc(x); // use it // the same thing in 1 line var sxc2 = $2sxc(document.getElementById(\"myApp\")); With jQuery (not recommended, jQuery should be seen as end-of-life): // the same thing in 1 line var sxc = $2sxc($(\"#myApp\")[0]); Note that the simple example above assumes that there is only one item on the page, but there can often be more. In that scenario you'll need to loop or something. Get with a Module ID (Inline) In this method, you need to get the ModuleId from somewhere, usually provided by the server-side template. In a Token-Template you would use [Module:ModuleId] and in a Razor-Template it's @Dnn.Module.ModuleID (large \"ID\"). The same code in Razor for Dnn and Oqtane would be: $(function () { var sxc = $2sxc(@CmsContext.Module.Id); alert(\"edit mode: \" + sxc.isEditMode()); }) The same code in Tokens would be: $(function () { var sxc = $2sxc([Module:ModuleId]); alert(\"edit mode: \" + sxc.isEditMode()); }) You can also find an example of finding all of our nodes and initializing them in the TimeLineJS App. If you're interested, here's the js-initializer. Get Sxc with External JavaScript When using external vanilla JavaScript, you will need: either a strong naming convention - such as making sure your app always has a tag with id myAmazingApp or pass it a tag or ID to get started. If you use a strong naming convention, this is the same as the inline-JavaScript-method. // the same thing in 1 line var sxc = $2sxc(document.getElementById(\"myAmazingApp\")); If you want to pass in the name or something, then the external file would look something like this: function startWithId(moduleId) { var sxc = $2sxc(moduleId); alert(\"edit mode: \" + sxc.isEditMode()); } function alertFromTag(tag) { var sxc = $2sxc(tag); alert(\"edit mode: \" + sxc.isEditMode()); } And the page would contain code such as: <!-- Run a script--> <script> startWithId(@CmsContext.Module.Id); </script> <!-- use the this-dom element --> <a onclick='alertFromTag(this)'>show edit mode</a> Get Sxc with External JavaScript and turnOn turnOn is a special helper to boot your JavaScript. It's especially useful because you cannot always rely on the loading order / speed of scripts, on scripts which may depend on other libraries to run as well. Read more about turnOn. Use Module ID with turnOn Razor File - example taken from the Counter App: @inherits Custom.Hybrid.Razor14 @using ToSic.Sxc.Services; @{ // Basics / Preparation Kit.Page.Activate(\"turnOn\"); var domId = \"app-counter2-js-\" + CmsContext.Module.Id; } <div id=\"@domId\" data-count=\"@fact.Number\"> <!-- more --> </div> @* include the JS, at the bottom of the page *@ <script src=\"@App.Path/scripts.js\" @pageSvc.AssetAttributes(position: \"bottom\") ></script> <turnOn turn-on='{ \"run\": \"window.initMyApp()\", \"data\": { \"domId\": \"@domId\" }}'></turnOn> JavaScript / TypeScript File: function initMyApp({ domId } : { domId: string }) { var sxc = $2sxc(document.getElementById(domId)); // ... } Use Tag with turnOn This is almost the same as with the Module ID, but the tag is passed in automatically. Note that this requires v14.02 with turnOn v0.1.2. JavaScript / TypeScript File: function initMyApp(data: any, context: any) { var sxc = $2sxc(document.getElementById(context.tag)); // ... } Technical Features Explained Everything is Cached We optimized for just about every thinkable situation, so the $2sxc will build a controller-object for a module, but following calls to it will use the cached information. Example: var sxc = $2sxc(42); // initial call, will build controller for Module 42 var sxc2 = $2sxc(42); // second call, will use cached controller var sxc3 = $2sxc(domNodeInsideTheModule42); // another call, will also used cached controller History Introduced in 2sxc 04.00 Enhanced the $2sxc(...) constructor with the ContextIdentifier in v11.11"

Or if things don't behave as expected. Environment and Context Data Needed by $2sxc to Work The $2sxc object needs a few pieces of information to work properly, which are usually stored in two locations: In a page-header Meta tag with the Id _jsApi In JSON in the HTML where the Module start So the Module-DIV-Tag is actually enhanced with additional pieces of information. This structure is open and easy to read, but the structure can change from time to time, so don't read/rely on that JSON, use the $2sxc to access any information. There are even situations where additional context data in inserted into the HTML rendered by your template. This has to do with inner-content (see next section) and the same \"don't rely on the JSON\" applies. How Page and Portal Information is Found This is for information the $2sxc needs for WebApi calls. This here applies to 2sxc 10.25+ It first checks the html-head section for a meta tag with the name _jsApi. If this exists, it contains a JSON with everything it needs. If that doesn't exist it will retry 3x times (in case the head wasn't ready yet) and otherwise falls back to the old mechanism. The old mechanism (Dnn only) is to ask Dnn and the ServicesFramework for this information. This is always available when you're logged on as an editor, but it's only on the page for anonymous users IF ...you are either using the old mechanisms ...or your Razor activated it on explicitly How Module-Level Information is found When you use $2sxc(moduleId) it scans the DOM for the <div> tag that contains the module with that ID When you use $2sxc(htmlNode) it starts from that node and scans all parents till it finds the <div> which is the module wrapper Once it finds that, it knows what module it's for and configures itself Module-Instances and Content-Blocks This is a very advanced topic, so if you're new - just skip this. Also if you use content-blocks you don't need to understand this, it's just included for completeness. A 2sxc-module can contain many 2sxc-content-blocks since version 8.4 because an item could have independent, inner content-blocks. Because of this, the controller may need an additional parameter, so instead of $2sxc(moduleId) it can also use $2sxc(moduleId, contentBlockId). As mentioned above, you never need to work with this, it's included for completeness. Since the now recommended method to initialized $2sxc is not with the moduleId but with a DOM-node, that call will automatically resolve everything correctly. Everything is Cached We optimized for just about every thinkable situation, so the $2sxc will build a controller-object for a module, but following calls to it will use the cached information. Example: var sxc = $2sxc(42); // initial call, will build controller for Module 42 var sxc2 = $2sxc(42); // second call, will use cached controller var sxc3 = $2sxc(domNodeInsideTheModule42); // another call, will also used cached controller History Introduced in 2sxc 04.00 Enhanced the $2sxc(...) constructor with the ContextIdentifier in v11.11"

Step 1: Activate the JS APIs If you are logged in as SiteAdmin or SystemAdmin, all the JS APIs are already loaded. So if you only want to customize the edit experience for admins, you can skip this step. If you need to use the JS APIs on public pages, you must first activate them. In 2sxc v14 or newer you would do this: @inherits Custom.Hybrid.Razor14 @{ // Tell the page that we need the 2sxc Js APIs Kit.Page.Activate(\"2sxc.JsCore\"); } This will load and activate the standard JavaScript APIs and let you get data using the Data Service and the Query Service. If your public / anonymous users also need CMS features (such as open the edit dialog), you would replace the \"2sxc.JsCore\" with \"2sxc.JsCms\". To even create visible toolbars (which requires some CSS) use \"2sxc.Toolbars\". Read more about activating page features here. For older versions consult the activate instructions. Step 2: Get the Current Sxc Object Once you've activated the JS APIs, there will be a window.$2sxc(...) function/object. It's primary purpose is to get you an Sxc object. Tip A page can contain many 2sxc Apps and Modules. For your code to work easily, it needs to get an Sxc object for the current App. There are a few ways to get the current Sxc object: Using the module ID with inline code: const sxc = $2sxc(17); Using the module ID with inline code and Razor: const sxc = $2sxc(@CmsContext.Module.Id); Using any html tag in the DOM: <a onclick='alert($2sxc(this))'>layout</a> There are more ways to do this - see How to get Sxc. Step 3: Use the Sxc to get Data or Perform CMS Actions Once you have the Sxc object of the current App, you can do all kinds of things. Use the .data(...) to get or create data on the current App Use the .query(...) to get data from a Query Use the .webApi.fetchJson(...) to get data from a WebAPI Use the .cms.run(...) to run CMS commands"

Please use newer APIs instead like .cms.run(...) you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .edit-custom { visibility: visible; } The manage object helps you manage content, allowing you to run(...) commands or to get buttons or toolbars. How to use Each content-block (usually a Dnn-Module) has it's own 2sxc-instance, which also gives you a prepared manage-object to work with. Here's an example <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run(\"layout\")'>layout</a> this click-event will look up the 2sxc-instance using $2sxc(this), then use the manage-object provided by this to then run the layout command. The layout command opens the change-template dialog. Here's an example to generate a toolbar from code: <p class=\"sc-element\"> mouse over this to see the js toolbar generated by the groups of buttons <toolbarsGroups></toolbarsGroups> </p> <script> var toolbarsGroups = { groups: [ { buttons: \"layout,more\"}, { buttons: \"app,zone,more\" } ] }; $(function(){ $(\"toolbarsGroups\").each(function(index, element){ var sxc = $2sxc(element); var toolbar = sxc.manage.getToolbar(toolbarsGroups); $(element).replaceWith(toolbar); }); }); </script> The example above has a function which will look for all <toolbarsGroups> tags and replace them with the HTML provided by manage.getToolbar(...). How it works Basically the manage-property only exists when the user has edit permissions, as 2sxc will automatically include the necessary JS in the page. So if the user doesn't have edit-rights, the .manage property will be undefined. If it does exist, it can be used to do perform these kinds of actions. Properties and Methods We try to keep APIs very light, so all the internal properties/objects are not documented and should not be used. These properties and methods can be treated as stable: void .run(...) - used to run a command string .getButton(...) - used to generate HTML for a single button (which when pressed, runs a command) - see buttons and toolbars string .getToolbar(...) - used to generate HTML for a toolbar (with buttons, which run commands) - see buttons and toolbars Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App JS Manage / Toolbar API Tutorial App History Introduced in 2sxc v02.00 Officially released & documented for use in 2sxc v08.06"

Note: If you want to use other AJAX libraries, check out the Bare Metal APIs. Simple APIs The simple APIs perform a browser fetch and return a promise. This is very similar to jQuery. webApi.fetchRaw(...) performs a basic fetch and returns a standard promise containing a Response object webApi.fetchJson(...) performs a fetch and returs a promise containing an object which came from JSON recommended Parameters All of these methods can be called with just 1 parameter, the url. But for more control, you can have these parameters: url - short api url like controller/method?params or other variations (see below) data - optional POST data, empty by default. Can be a string or an object. If it's an object, it will auto-convert to JSON method - optional method name, default is GET, unless you specify data, in which case it defaults to POST Url The url can be any one of these: Api URL pointing to a WebAPI of the app - short like controller/method or long like app/auto/controller/method Query url with a query name like app/auto/query/queryName Data url pointing to the data like app/auto/data/contentType These can also have parameters like controller/method?id=27 or app/auto/data/contentType/574 depending on what the endpoint expects. Helper for URLs with Parameters v13 2sxc 13 enhances the webApi.url(...) function to build a url using a parameters object.

You should use Angular The files in the folder /js/angularjs such as 2sxc4ng.js, 2sxc4ng.min.js and angular.min.js were supposed to be removed in v12.0 but were somehow included again by accident. We discovered this and removed them again in v16.06. If for some random reason you need it, get them from this git repo: 2sxc-js-archive 2sxc contains a special helper called 2sxc4ng which takes care of starting your app inside Dnn and providing you with toolbars and data from 2sxc. How to use Until we find time to document everything, here's the short version To use 2sxc4ng you must include a JS file in your template, and you must bootstrap your app using this (not using the standard angularjs bootstrapping) this is to ensure that multiple Angular apps can run on the same page, and to provide your app with the necessary context so it knows what module it's working on, etc. Here's an introduction to that. To get your current sxc-controller there are two objects $2sxc and sxc which you can just include it in your function definition, like module.controller('AppCatalogCtrl', function ($2sxc, sxc, $http, ...) { The sxc is the one you want most, it is already set to your current instance, so you can ask it things like sxc.manage etc. The $2sxc is the same as the global $2sxc object you know from jquery. You could of course also do $2sxc(27).manage to access the manage, but that's unnecessarily complicated Additional services provided when bootstrapping with 2sxc4ng is content(typename) - a service which requests content-data from the current app / context, can also delete / create items etc. query(queryname) - a service which gets data from app-queries Additional directives sxcToolbar - a create-toolbar directive to provide in-app toolbars to edit/manage etc. for <sxc-toolbar toolbar=\"...\"> tags Todo: a simple full example right here Including All Necessary Files You need three files + your code 2sxc.min.js - only necessary, if you intend to work with 2sxc data items & toolbars, must come before 2sxc4ng Angular - ideally from a CDN 2sxc4ng.min.js - only necessary, if you intend to work with 2sxc data items & toolbars, must come after angular Your code Example: <script src=\"/desktopmodules/tosic_sexycontent/js/2sxc.api.min.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"100\"></script> <script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.1/angular.min.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"101\"></script> <script src=\"/desktopmodules/tosic_sexycontent/js/angularjs/2sxc4ng.min.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"110\"></script> <script src=\"@App.Path/dist/angular-app.min.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"120\"></script> Toolbar Directive Quick example - this requires 2sxc 8.8 // a quick sxcToolbar example <li ng-repeat=\"app in apps\"> <sxc-toolbar toolbar='{ \"entityId\": app.EntityId }' settings='{ \"hover\": \"left\", \"align\": \"left\" }'></sxc-toolbar> ... </li> Content Service This is a quick example of the content service Todo: you can find some infos till then in the (http://2sxc.org/en/Learn/Simple-AngularJS-in-DNN-with-2sxc4ng)(http://2sxc.org/en/Learn/Simple-AngularJS-in-DNN-with-2sxc4ng) article Important: you can use the content service to get all of a type get one of a type create one of a type (if permissions have been configured for that type) delete one of a type (permissions...) quick demo of syntax var cSrv = content(\"BlogPosts\"); var onePromise = cSrv.get(740); var allPromise = cSrv.get(); var createPromise = cSrv.create({ \"Title\": \"hello\", \"Body\": \"great article\"}); var deletePromise = cSrv.delete(7740); Query Service This is a quick example of the query service Todo: you can find some infos till then in the (http://2sxc.org/en/Learn/Simple-AngularJS-in-DNN-with-2sxc4ng)(http://2sxc.org/en/Learn/Simple-AngularJS-in-DNN-with-2sxc4ng) article // this example assumes you added the query service in your constructor // it also assumes you created a visual-query called \"All-blog-items\" var qAll = query(\"All-blog-items\"); qAll.get().then(function (result) { ... // some code here }); // this assumes you want to query the data from the current view // so the real items assigned to this instance // or processed inside the view in a PrepareData() method var qCurrent = query(); qCurrent.get().then(function (result) { ... // some code here }); When working with queries that expect parameters, you can pass them in the get() call qAll.get({ data: { \"sort\": \"EntityTitle\" }, }).then(...) Notes and Clarifications On Bootstrapping Just fyi: in 2sxc 6.0 till 2sxc 8.8.0 the AngularJS bootstrapping needed to know the module-id. This was done by either providing an attribute like iid=\"@Dnn.Module.ModuleId\" or for tokens iid=\"[Module:ModuleId]\" providing the mod-id in the app name like sxc-app=\"MyApp-@Dnn.Module.ModuleId\" This is because it needs if for webservice calls. In 2sxc 8.8.1 the bootstrapping will auto-detect the module id, so you don't have to provide it any more.

Example This is some example code @Component({ /* stuff */ }) export class BusinessUnitSelectorComponent { constructor(private data: Data) { // Query backend for stream of BusinessUnit[] // This creates a content-manager object (note the missing $) const businessUnits = data.content<BusinessUnit>('BusinessUnit'); // now get all const businessUnits$ = businessUnits.get(); // or just one by ID const oneBu$ = businessUnits.get(402); oneBu$.subscribe((bu) => console.log(`Got BU ${bu.Name}`, bu)); // update a value (note: not implemented yet as of dnn-sxc-angular v11.01) businessUnites.post(402, { Name: 'New Name' }); } } Difference to Data.content$<T>(...) In most cases you'll prefer to use the content$ (...) API which is single use. The only really good case to use this is for updating data, but that hasn't been implemented yet. If you want to update data for now just use the normal sxc object on the Context"

Here's what it does We're using the Data object provided by dnn-sxc-angular The query$<T>(...) requests an observable stream of BusinessUnit[] objects The term ...('BusinessUnitTeam') is the name of the query The additional parameters like ?bu=Web is expected by the query (in this case the query could also accept an empty BU) Other overloads The query$<T>(...) has various other overloads to include parameters. You'll see them in the intellisense in VS Code. Difference to Data.query<T>(...) The Data object also has a query<T>(...) without the $. That doesn't return a stream/observable of data, but instead returns a Query object which can be used for multiple calls. As of now it's probably not very usefull, so let's stick to this."

This is what the HttpInterceptor does. It ensures that: Security headers like the RequestVerificationToken are included Context headers like ModuleId are correct Shorthand api urls like app/data/BlogPost are mapped to the correct endpoints How it works For this to work, the page must have this data available before Angular loads. Thanks to 2sxc (the non-angular parts) this is automatically provided ahead of time. Here's the initialization process behind the scenes: 2sxc adds important headers to the page on the server for 2sxc and dnn-sxc-angular to work (this happens automatically) When the root module is built (usually called AppModule) it must include DnnSxcRootModule to register the Http-Interceptor When Angular bootstraps the base class DnnAppComponent gets everything from the page when it's constructed. Without this the Http-Interceptor wouldn't have the configuration necessary. After this has happened, all calls using the Angular HttpClient will automatically behave as expected."

In most cases, you will want to use the [sxc-toolbar] tag-toolbar directive In rare cases you may prefer the inline <sxc-toolbar> toolbar is useful when you want to show the toolbar without the need to hover over the target element. Example We'll explain how to use toolbars based on the Template App. Check out the team.component.html - you'll see some code like this: <!-- #ExampleContentManagement - this shows how to use the toolbar with just the add-button for a specific type and also do custom view refresh --> <div [sxc-toolbar]=\"toolbarFor()\" (refresh)=\"teamSvc.refresh()\"> <h2>Team</h2> <app-business-unit-selector></app-business-unit-selector> <ol> <!-- #ExampleContentManagement - this will create a delete/edit toolbar for this item and will also do custom view refresh--> <li *ngFor=\"let person of team; trackBy: trackById\" [sxc-toolbar]=\"toolbarFor(person)\" (refresh)=\"teamSvc.refresh()\"> <app-person [person]=\"person\"></app-person> </li> </ol> <hr /> <app-team-explained></app-team-explained> </div> The code of team.component.ts is this: @Component({ /* stuff */ }) export class TeamComponent { /** The data which is shown in the template */ team: Person[] = []; constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute, public teamSvc: TeamService, private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) { this.teamSvc.team$.subscribe((newTeam => { this.team = newTeam; })); } /** * Create a toolbar configuration for a person or for new * #ExampleContentManagement */ toolbarFor(person?: Person) { const mainConfig = 'toolbar=empty?contentType=Person&entityId=' + (person?.Id ?? '0'); return person ? [mainConfig, \"edit\", \"delete&color=gray?entityGuid=\" + person.Guid + \"&title=\" + person.Name] : [mainConfig, 'new'] } } As you can see, the [sxc-toolbar] attribute activates the sxcToolbar directive of dnn-sxc-angular. The configuration for the toolbar is provided by the toolbarFor(...) call in the controller class and it uses the simple toolbar configuration system. That's how easy it is to create CMS toolbars in Angular 😉."

JSON Encode if using data-toolbar attribute If you're adding this in the HTML, then everything must be correctly JSON encoded (which isn't exactly fun). So if you plan to do that, we recommend to put most of the JS in an external file and just put the call to it in the button itself. More Specs On Click The second example shows 3 additional variables which are available inside the click event. They are settings - these are the parameters passed in, like entityId event - this is the JS event like click sxc - this is the current sxc-controller - you can also access sxc.manage if you need it History Introduced in 2sxc v08.06 Basically obsolete since v10 where you should use call instead"

Run Commands and Parameters Two commands in the 2sxc APIs allow running CMS commands $2sxc.cms.run(params: RunParamsWithContext) This is the run on the Global Cms object sxc.cms.run(params: RunParams) This is the run on the Instance Cms object Both of these commands will run a CMS command with parameters. Important There are some possibilities for confusion which you should be aware of. The $2sxc.cms.run(...) has a few old overloads with other parameters. We plan to discontinue these, as it had to do some magic to figure out what is what. So even if you find such code, please use the method described here. Read more: Various Run Commands Requirements and Prerequisites For this to work, the CMS JavaScripts must be loaded. This is done automatically or manually. If your user is an admin/editor, this happens automatically. If your user is not defined as an editor, but should still have these commands (possibly because the Content-Type allows editing for this user), you'll need to activate it manually. To activate these features manually just use the IPageService and activate 2sxc.JsCms. How to use (v13.03) Simple example: @{ // enable editing for all users GetService<ToSic.Sxc.Services.IPageService>().Activate(\"2sxc.JsCms\"); } <script> // Run the command and handle the returned promise // This uses the Instance object retrieved using $2sxc(tag) function addProject(tag) { $2sxc(tag).cms.run({ action: \"new\", params: { contentType: \"Project\"} }) .then(function () { alert(\"Thanks - we'll review your entry and publish it.\") }); } // This is the alternate way to write the code, using the Global object function addProjectAlternative(tag) { $2sxc.cms.run({ tag: tag, action: \"new\", params: { contentType: \"Project\"}}) .then(function () { alert(\"Thanks - we'll review your entry and publish it.\") }); }</script> <span onclick='window.addProject(this)'> add your project </span> the tag is an HTML tag in the DOM, which is used to look up the context automatically (see edit-context) the action is the verb for the cms-command to run the params contains additional parameters for that command Returned Promise The run always returns a promise. As you can see in the sample above, this lets you show a specific message or do other things after the command has run. To handle special cases like prevent a page-refresh or to do custom JS actions at certain points, check out the Workflows. RunParams and RunParamsWithContext Both commands take one object with named properties, to help keep the API stable across changes. Tip The Instance call on sxc.cms.run(...) uses the RunParams. It will throw an error if a context is also provided, because that indicates you're doing something wrong. On the other hand the Global call on the $2sxc.cms.run(...) explicitly needs RunParamsWithContext either tag or context, and will throw an error if both are missing. Command Workflow Example Commands can be called with additional workflow steps which are processed before or after certain steps. For example, you can prevent the page from refreshing - to trigger an own JS-Reload or something. 👉 Read more about Workflows and Steps.

    "keywords": "Various Run Commands you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .edit-custom { visibility: visible; } The API of 2sxc has changed with time, and we try ensure all samples include the latest best practices. But sometimes you'll stumble over old code or old samples, so we believe it's important you understand the differences. Newest CMS Run on the Sxc Object As of v13.03+, you should always use the .cms.run(...) command on the Sxc object. It always expects an object such as this: $2sxc(moduleId).cms.run({ action: \"edit\" }); $2sxc(moduleId).cms.run({ action: \"edit\", params: { entityId: 27 } }); $2sxc(moduleId).cms.run({ action: \"edit\", params: { entityId: 27 }, event: event }); This may feel a bit complicated, but it's to ensure that the API doesn't change as we add new features. Tip This is the only recommended run API we recommend as of now. It also supports workflows, so you can add code to intercept what happens, such as preventing page reloads after an edit command. This was introduced ca. 2sxc v13.03. Global CMS Run on the $2sxc Object The $2sxc.cms.run(...) is also available, but it's not recommended. It has many different overloads with different kinds of parameters which tend to confuse developers. Since most run-commands also need a context, you must provide this on the global run(...). If you would use the Sxc.cms.run(...) above, this isn't necessary as the context is known. This was introduced ca. 2sxc v9.30. Old Manage Run on the Sxc objects Previous versions of 2sxc had similar functionality on $2sxc.manage.run(...) $2sxc(moduleId).manage.run(...) These continue to work for compatibility reasons, but we highly recommend using the new .cms.run(...) instead. An important difference for the old manage.run(...) is that you could just write the command name into the call, such as $2sxc(moduleId).manage.run(\"edit\"). This may feel simpler, but it led to a lot of difficulties when more parameters were needed. This resulted in JS code that tries to guess what parameter was meant for what, so it's just not recommended. Some old examples: <!-- quick version with name only --> <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).manage.run('layout', event)\"> change layout </a> <!-- expanded version --> <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).manage.run({ action: 'layout' }, event)\"> change layout </a> <!-- expanded version with many params --> <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).manage.run({ action: 'new', contentType: 'BlogPost' }, event)\"> createBlogPost </a> These examples example gets the $2sxc-controller related to the <a> tag using $2sxc(this) and thereby giving it a context so it knows what module-id, etc. Then it executes the command. This was introduced ca. 2sxc v4.0. Warning Remember this is a depracecated API. It's only included to better understand old code. Use the new API. History Introduced old method ca. v4 Official API since 2sxc 08.06 Improved in 9.30 Massively improved in 13.03"

Make sure you first read the how to before you start. Since WYSIWYG is so complex, with image-handling, special paste etc. we believe most developers are better of using the existing system, and just reconfiguring it. That's what we'll explain here. Make sure TinyMCE is loaded We must first load the standard WYSIWYG control before we start, otherwise you'll run into timing issues. The best way to do this can be seen in the tutorial, but this is what you need: const builtInWysiwyg = '[System:Path]/system/field-string-wysiwyg/index.js'; /** Our WebComponent which is a custom, lightweight wysiwyg editor */ class StringWysiwygCustom extends HTMLElement { /* connectedCallback() is the standard callback when the component has been attached */ connectedCallback() { // We need to ensure that the standard WYSIWYG is also loaded this.connector.loadScript('tinymce', builtInWysiwyg, (x) => { this.initWysiwygCallback() }) } initWysiwygCallback() { // ... } } This way the form will load the built-in WYSIWYG control and trigger your callback, OR if it has already been loaded, immediately trigger your callback. Configure the TinyMCE WYSIWYG Web Control The control has these public properties: mode - values can be edit and preview, default is preview connector - the object that every form control needs. You must connect this reconfigure a special object that can change the configuration at various points Code Sample: const tagName = 'field-string-wysiwyg-micro'; const builtInWysiwyg = '[System:Path]/system/field-string-wysiwyg/index.js'; /** Our WebComponent which is a custom, lightweight wysiwyg editor */ class StringWysiwygCustom extends HTMLElement { /* connectedCallback() is the standard callback when the component has been attached */ connectedCallback() { // We need to ensure that the standard WYSIWYG is also loaded this.connector.loadScript('tinymce', builtInWysiwyg, (x) => { this.initWysiwygCallback() }) } initWysiwygCallback() { // 1. Create a built-in field-string-wysiwyg control const wysiwyg = document.createElement('field-string-wysiwyg'); // 2. tell it if it should start in preview or edit wysiwyg.mode = 'edit'; // can be 'preview' or 'edit' // 3. attach connector wysiwyg.connector = this.connector; // 4. also attach reconfigure object which can change the TinyMCE as it's initialized wysiwyg.reconfigure = new WysiwygReconfigurator(); // 5. Append it to the DOM. Do this last, as it will trigger connectedCallback() in the wysiwyg this.appendChild(wysiwyg); } } /** The object which helps reconfigure what the editor will do */ class WysiwygReconfigurator { configureOptions(options) { options.toolbar = \"undo redo | bold italic\" return options; } } // Register this web component - if it hasn't been registered yet if (!customElements.get(tagName)) customElements.define(tagName, StringWysiwygCustom); connector Object for the connector object please consult connector API Understanding TinyMCE and Life-Cycle TincMCE has a huge set of options, so let's just get a quick idea of how things work inside it Once loaded, there is a global tinymce object which is like a master-controller for all tinyMCE editors. We call it the Editor Manager Each editor has a personal editor object which has the configuration for just that editor What is configured on tinymce? The global tinymce controller is responsible for things like Translations options, including plugins which are activated skin and theme custom_elements ...and way more What is configured on an editor? Buttons (for use in Toolbars) Toolbars ADAM and Dnn-Bridge Initialization Process / Life-Cycle This is how the control is loaded / built in the 2sxc/EAV form. Note that for each method explained on the reconfigure object, the initializers will do duck typing to check if that method exists and if detected, will run that. #1 Load Phase The field-string-wysiwyg WebControl is created At this time, the mode, connector and reconfigure must already be set by the parent It will requests that the from loads all the TinyMCE JavaScripts When that has completed, it will fire a callback to start translating / configuring #2 Translation Phase In this phase, translation maps are built, so buttons can show labels in various languages. This map is global, so try to avoid name clashes. First the built-in translations of 2sxc/EAV are added Then reconfigure.addTranslations(editorManager, currentLanguage) is called. In this phase you can add your own translations according to tinyMCE standards or modify prebuilt translations. #3 Manager Configuration Phase At the beginning reconfigure.managerInit(editorManager) is called so you can pre-initialize something. We don't really know why you would need this, but we added it just in case. Then the default options are generated Now reconfigure.optionsInit(options, buttonOptions) is called. Here you can change the objects as you need to add/remove options. the options are the standard tinyMCE options which have been prebuilt The buttonOptions are a special object which affects automatic button definitions. This is still WIP Now the configuration system builds more options based on the environment, features etc. Then it calls reconfigure.optionsReady(options) so you could make some final changes. Now tinymce (the Editor Manager) receives the options to start. This also includes a callback (provided by our form) which will do editor initialization. #4 Editor Configuration Phase When the tinyMCE editor is finally created, a callback or the wysiwyg is triggered. This will attach various events like init, focus, blur, change, undo etc. Once attaching these events is done, it calls reconfigure.editorBuilt(editor) so you could make changes. When init is triggered, it will first call reconfigure.editorInit(editor) so you can make changes or add buttons using the tinyMCE API. It will then run internal code to add all the button definitions like H1, H2 etc. Then it asks for reconfigure.disablePagePicker and if not true, will attach the Dnn page picker It will also ask for reconfigure.disableAdam and if not true, will attach ADAM functionality How to Modify the Behavior Best check out these tutorials Basic tutorial, just providing 4 standard buttons Advanced tutorial adding a custom button History New system in 2sxc 11 using WebComponents (previously this was not possible)"

Tip 2sxc 11 finally allows you to do this using simple WebComponents Registering these happens by placing them in a specific folder You can also make them configurable by placing a content-type json in another folder Note There are more ways to provide and register custom input fields - like when you need them globally across many apps and portals. That is not discussed here. Quick-Start Video and Tutorial If you're new here, best watch this video: Then check out the tutorials. What kind of Custom Input Field can you Create You can create any kind of custom input field, as a JavaScript WebComponent. Look and Feel however you want it Any kind of JS code Talking to any other system (Google Maps, etc.) Talking to any endpoint (weather APIs) Tip This overview will get you started, but we've already created demos on the 2sxc Tutorials. If you want to know more, you should also read the specs Getting Started with Custom Input Fields Basically a custom Input Field is just a index.js in the correct folder. These are the specs: An input field as described here is an App Extension. All App Extensions must each lie in an own folder... within a folder called system inside the App folder The folder name for your custom input field must obey certain naming rules so that they are auto-detected. The javascript that will be loaded must be called index.js Your script must register a custom element - a WebComponent - in the browser The name of your custom element is predefined, and must adhere to the naming rules. Here's a checklist to get this setup Note Once you have that setup, the input field is automatically detected and a user can choose it as a field type in the configuration. Some Background on WebComponents The WebComponent has a simple lifecycle - from when it's created to when it receives data and can push changes back to the form. The form itself is reactive. This means that your field will receive messages when the value changes or when other values change (in case you want to use other field values in your input). The API to communicate with the form has a few complexities you need to know. This is because the form is very dynamic - so the user could switch languages, and your input field needs to react to this. So let's get started 🚀! Getting the HTML into the Custom Input WebControls are developed using pure JavaScript, but a control is automatically a rich DOM object. So your this object can do all kinds of DOM manipulations, but in most cases you'll just do something like this: this.innerHTML = 'Hello <em>world</em>!'; Now you have to wait with doing this, till your object has been added to the DOM, so you need to kick this off in the connectedCallback() like this: class EmptyHelloWorld extends HTMLElement { /* Constructor for WebComponents - the first line must always be super() */ constructor() { super(); } /* connectedCallback() is the standard callback when the component has been attached */ connectedCallback() { this.innerHTML = 'Hello <em>world</em>!'; } } Reading and Writing Values The 2sxc form will initialize your custom element and attach a connector object. This happens automatically, so you will have it once connectedCallback() is fired. This connector is a rich object with lots of stuff, but for your field value you need to know these bits connector.data.value gets you the current value connector.data.update(newValue) updates the form with the changed value connector.data.value$ is the observable version of the value - this is great for advanced use cases, but otherwise you can stick to the simple .value Tip Avoid calling update(...) if nothing changed - as it will make the form dirty, so the user will be asked if he wants to save when cancelling the dialog, even though nothing changed. Tip Check out this tutorial example of Pickr to see all this in action Loading Custom CSS and JS Libraries Since this is all standard JavaScript, you can do it anyhow you want. For example, to load some CSS we recommend that you simply add a <link> tag to your html, like this: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@simonwep/pickr/dist/themes/classic.min.css\"/> For JavaScript you can do the same, either using a <script> tag or telling the browser to load the JS using DOM commands. We also provide a helper on connector.loadScript(name, url, callback) which does the following: Check if the name given in the first parameter exists on the window object (to check if it's already loaded) If not, load the script provided in the url Watch the window object using polling to see when the item with name is created Then trigger your callback function Tip Check out the tutorial example of Pickr to see all this in action Making your Fields Configurable Now you have a color-picker, but each field may require a different set of preconfigured colors. Or maybe your date picker has could optionally restrict dates to weekdays. In these cases, you need configuration specific for the field. Create Your own WYSIWYG Field WYSIWYG fields are very hard to do right. Basically you can simply create your own using the same principles as mentioned above. But we recommend that you use the existing WYSIWYG field provided by 2sxc and just change some of the configurations. Tip By just reconfiguring the existing 2sxc WYSIWYG you will benefit from ADAM file-upload and continuous updates to the main component. Here's what you need to know The WYSIWYG field is based on TinyMCE - so to make configuration changes, you'll need to understand that API pretty well. To change it, you need to create a wrapper component which contains the standard 2sxc-wysiwyg and give it different configurations. To do this, we are calling various methods on a reconfigure object of your wrapper - so you can override most of the defaults To learn more, best look at the tutorials and the API Basic tutorial, just providing 4 standard buttons Advanced tutorial adding a custom button WYSIWYG Reconfigure API"

Tip Removing jQuery and jQueryUI will boost your mobile PageSpeed like crazy. So only include it on pages where you really need it. Warning We believe jQuery was once amazing, but should be seen as end-of-life. Our docs still show how to work with it, but we highly recommend to stop using it. See also our blog How Dnn Auto-Loades jQuery There is some history to this which we'll explain briefly. Dnn made jQuery a first-class citizen around Dnn 4, and since then most of the UI was jQuery based. For a while there even was a standard that buttons etc. should be built and styled with jQuery UI. That is not the case any more. You can now easily run Dnn (at least in browsing mode, not editing) without jQuery. But because jQuery was always there developers never noticed that they could leave it away, and many parts like Templates would simply rely on them. There were also many things that automatically added jQuery but were never noticed. Here some important examples: 2sxc always used the ServicesFramework of Dnn which internally auto-added jQuery Most Dnn websites use popups for login, and just doing this automatically adds jQueryUI and jQuery to the page. You can easily stop this using the recipe Remove jQueryUI from my page In case your code is running on a page without jQuery but you need it, your code should tell Dnn that you want jQuery, like this: Warning Don't manually add urls to the jQuery files, make sure you use the official API. This should help you prevent loading jQuery multiple times and avoid conflicts between jQuery version. Tip If you do need a newer version of jQuery, that is possible but needs some tweaking to get them to run side-by-side. It's done using the jQuery.noConflict(). How 2sxc loads jQuery in Dnn Up until 2sxc 10.24, every 2sxc module automatically loaded jQuery because 2sxc used the ServicesFramework of Dnn Starting from 2sxc 10.25 old templates auto-load jQuery for backward compatibility. This includes token-templates and Razor templates which don't have an @inherits statement at the beginning. Anything new done using the RazorComponent will not do that unless your template code requests it. In 2sxc 10.25 and newer, all core features of 2sxc don't need jQuery. So anonyomus browsing of your site won't require jQuery at all, even if you're doing API calls or using the $2sxc javascript API. But what you do need if you're using the new RazorComponent, is to tell 2sxc that you plan to use JavaScript and APIs. This lets 2sxc add the stuff to the page to make the magic happen. See Activate 2sxc JavaScript APIs on a Page. Because 2sxc doesn't use jQuery any more for normal stuff, this will have the following effect: Add a special header to the page containing information needed for API calls Load the 2sxc.api.min.js in the correct way It's important to note that this will not load jQuery."

It also lets you specify all kinds of things in a central manner. Prerequisite: Specify what Settings are available For security reasons, the API can't read any settings by default. This is because Formulas run in the context of the current editor, and some settings are sensitive. So to enable the settings, you must first specify which settings are available.

See Where Formulas are Stored. When do Formulas Run? As of now, they run whenever any data changes in the form. This can mean that they run multiple times because if formulas depend on each other, there may be a few cycles till all values stabilize. Can Formulas detect Lifecycle Information? As of now the formulas always run on every change detection. The following information is currently not yet given to the formula: What phase of the lifecycle the formula is on (init, pre-render, etc.) Events which happened before Run-count If you really need this, your formula can track this using the context.cache object. Can Formulas be Disabled? Stored Formulas can be disabled with a toggle in the field settings. In v2 (🆕 2sxc 16) this is possible by returning a object with {stop: true}. This will stop the formula from running again. In v1 you cannot disable Formulas at runtime. Even Formulas whose result is discarded are still run on every cycle - this is by design. If you need to stop a formula in v1, do this by placing a value on context.cache (see Formulas Tutorials). Can Formulas run on Specific Events? This is not yet possible."

Step 1: Discover Live Examples 🔬 First you must look at the live samples in Formulas Tutorials If you did this, you should now have seen What formulas tend to look like All kinds of things they can affect That they run in the browser, and keep updating with every interaction Step 2: Get to Know the Formula Designer 👉 To develop Formulas use the Interactive Formula Designer Step 3: Try it Yourself 👉 Check out the JS Formula Documentation - also the data and context objects 👉 Also read about the Formula Targets and Return Values Tips and Tricks While developing, always keep the F12-Console open to see what's happening You can always add a console.log(data, context); or similar in your code to see in real time what's being processed. You can also add a line debugger; and the browser will stop at this line so you can inspect the variables and watch your code. Do use Formulas as pure functions. Step 4: Go Deeper You should also check Ephemeral / Temporary Fields as they are very useful together with Formulas. Know that you can also use webApi calls on the context.sxc.webApi to get data from the backend (see tutorials) Also read about the empty-end Field to close a Field-Group as it's useful when grouping fields.

    "title": "Return Date-Values in Formulas | 2sxc 16 / EAV 16",
    "keywords": "Return Date-Values in Formulas Date values can cause problems, because when you are working with them in JavaScript, the time zone is always important. Internally dates are stored as strings, not as Date objects. The UI doesn't care about time zones, so the strings always use Zulu time and not the local time zone. This may cause some challenges which you want to know about. Returned Date Objects If your function returns a date-object we will assume that you were creating a new date and didn't worry about time zones. So we will simply drop the time-zone information and assume that's what you wanted. So if you do return new Date(); it will contain something like Tue Jun 08 2021 11:22:33 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time). We will treat this as 2021-06-08T11:22:33 and ignore the time zone. The UI will then also show 2021-06-08 11:22:33 Returned Date Strings If you return a date-string without time-zone like 2021-06-08 10:00 we will assume this is what you want, and treat it as such. If you return a date-string with time zone like 2021-06-08 10:00 +0200 we will assume you used something like new Date().toString() and ignore the time zone, so we'll keep 2021-06-08 10:00 because you almost certainly didn't realize that the toString() would result in a wrong time. Likely Problems on Date-Formulas Basically if you create a new Date() object and return that, everything will work as expected. And you construct a UTC-only date everything will work too. Where things will surprise you is when you convert the data.value and simply return it without making corrections. These things will cause problems: Problem: return new Date(data.value); No Problem: return new Date(); Problem: var x = new Date(data.value); x.setMinutes(0); x.setSeconds(0); return x; No Problem: var x = new Date(); x.setMinutes(0); x.setSeconds(0); return x; Problem: var otherFieldDate = new Date(data.Birthday).getDay(); will probably return the wrong day This is because our data.value doesn't have a time zone, and converting it to Date(...) will construct a date in the users time zone resulting in a shift by a few hours. So this will only affect formulas which use the existing date, modify it, and are not aware of the time-zones. To fix this, make sure that if you convert existing data to a Date, you pretend it's in the time-zone changes of the current browser. This example shows a formula that will remove the time on a new date or the existing one. v1(data, context) { // Use existing date (but pretend it's local time by dropping 'Z') or use current Date var date = data.value ? new Date(data.value.replace('Z', '')) : new Date(); date.setHours(0,0,0,0); // flush all time parts return date; } Another option is to work with the Zulu time but make sure you UTC it when returning, or work with .getTimezoneOffset().

The Target The target key of a formula determines what your Formula will affect. Since data.value contains what would be used if your formula didn't run, then this of course will also contain the previous value of the target. These are the possible targets: Field.Value - will get / set a value on a field Field.Settings - will get will get/set a setting of the field. This is just the Type identifier. A full key often includes the exact setting to be addressed, like Field.Settings.Name - change the label / name / title of a field Field.Settings.Visible - Controls the visibility of the field / group. true means visible Field.Settings.Disabled - controls that the field can be interacted with or is disabled. true means it's blocked Field.Settings.Required - shows if a field is required warning required isn't fully implemented ATM - the form will not always reliably enforce this if it's changed dynamically *. Field.Settings.Notes to change the description / help-text (v14) Field.Settings._[Anything]_ - other Settings that can be changed, eg. Field.Settings.Collapsed on a field-group to change if it's open/closed Field.Settings.DropdownValues on dropdown fields (new v15) Field.Validation - show errors/warnings on a field based on the input 🆕 v16 Tip Remember that data.value contains the value which is used if the formula doesn't run or doesn't return anything. If you need the value in the field/setting at form-load, use data.default. And if you are doing some prefill-magic, you can get that on data.prefill. 👉 Read more about this is the JS Docs. Field Value Formulas These are the most common formulas, as they are used to get/set the value of a field. Each field type or property may expect a different data type. Make sure you provide that. So if you are updating a boolean field, you should return a boolean value. Formulas for Common Settings Field.Settings.Name - Label of a Field This can be changed as needed. We recommend that you never add * to the name, as this is the indicator for required and would confuse users. On field groups we often use this to add emojis such as ✅ or ❌ to indicate if the fields inside are what is needed. Expected type: string Field.Settings.Visible - Show/Hide a Field Shows/hides a field or a group of fields. When you set this on a group, it applies to all properties in the group. So hiding a group hides all fields inside it, showing it shows all fields inside it. Expected type: boolean Field.Settings.Disabled - Enable/Disable a Field If you return true to set Disabled=true it will disable the UI. Of course if the field is already not visible, the user won't see this. Important Even if you set Disabled=false other rules may override this. For example, if the field may not be translated and you're on a secondary language, it will still remain disabled. Important Disabling a group will not disable all the fields in it. We may consider implementing this some day, but as of now it won't happen, so you'll need to disable each field if this is what you need. Expected type: boolean Field.Settings.Required - Mark Field as Required This determines if the Field is required. Important Changing the required changes the * indicator on the UI, but as of v12.01 it doesn't yet affect the validity checks in the form. This is an important limitation to be aware of. Expected type: boolean Formulas for Special Settings Field.Settings.Collapsed - for Groups This is a setting which only would affect group fields. Setting Collapsed to true collapses the group, to false opens it. Tip Remember that data.default will always give you the initial state of this setting. Expected type: boolean Field.Settings.DropdownValues - for DropDowns Field.Settings.[Anything] Since many controls can have other settings these can be controlled by formulas as well. Important We haven't tried every setting and some may not have the expected result, since the form has never been this dynamic before. We'll work on fixing issues as we hear about them. Formulas for Validation Field.Validation - Show Errors/Warnings This is a special kind of formula as it only affects the hints below the input field. Best check out the tutorials to see it in action.

Improvements include: Intellisense while typing the formula using VS Code Promise support Ability to stop the formula from running Ability to set other fields from a formula Ability to add Comments before the formula Ability to get App Settings in your formula Ability to return Validation on a field V2 Function Specs // new formula syntax - see https://go.2sxc.org/formulas v2((data, context) => { return data.value; }); All functions must be called v2, it must be lower case This is important because when APIs change, we will use v3, etc. The first line in the code must start with the function name v2. You can put comments or empty lines before the v2, but they must always use // and not /* */ The v2(...) function takes 1 parameter, namely the function to execute. This is different from v1. The reason we need an inner function is so that VS Code can provide intellisense while you type. Your function must look like one of these v2(() => { ... }); v2((data) => { ... }); v2((data, context) => { ... }); The parameter names are anything you want, but the order of what you get is always data and then context. You can also write v2((d, c) => { ... }); The data and context Objects 👉🏼 See data 👉🏼 See context Return Values on v2 You can return the same data as you did in v1 but we now have more options: return the value which should be used, like return true; or return data.value; (same as v1) return a special FormulaResult-object (specs below) like return { value: true, stop: true }; return a promise which will resolve to one of the above return a special validation object (specs below) For the next part of the documentation, we'll refer to the value to be used as the Value and if a special object is returned, we'll call it the FormulaResult. TODO: Validation The FormulaResult Object For advanced features, the formula must be able to return multiple values, which is why we have the FormulaResult object. It has the following properties - all of which are optional: value - the value to be used as the result of the formula stop - if true, the formula will stop and not execute any other formulas promise - a promise to run - eg. in scenarios where we returned a value for now, and a promise for later fields - an array of fields to be set, each with a name and value property The Returned Value The returned value is either a simple value returned directly using return '...'; or the value property of the FormulaResult object. Each field type or property may expect a different data type. Make sure you provide that. So if you are updating a boolean field, you should return a boolean value. Warning If you return nothing, undefined or the wrong data type, the result will be ignored and the value/setting will not be changed. Common Mistakes returning nothing with return; - this will be regarded as an error and be ignored. returning undefined. Returning a falsy instead of a real true or false for a boolean value returning a date with the wrong timezone - see returning dates Returning a Promise This is a highlight in v2. Any formula can now return a promise, or a FormulaResult object with a promise property. The promise itself can then return a value or a FormulaResult object. Tip When a promise is returned, it behaves as if stop was set to true. So returned promises deactivate the formula to not run again. If your code is more sophisticated and needs to run again, then the promise should also return something like { value: 'new value', stop: false }. Returning Validation Information Field Validations are errors/warnings about the contents of the field. The purpose is to do very special validations, or to show a warning for values which could be ok, but are not recommended. A validation object return looks like this: { severity: 'warning', message: 'please use lower case only', } Since the this kind of return value is an object, in can easily be confused with a FormulaResult object. So to return this object, it must be wrapped in a FormulaResult object like this: return { value: { severity: 'warning', message: 'please use lower case only', } }; You can see an example of this in the tutorial. Tips and Tricks You can always add a console.log(data, context); or similar in your code to see in real time what's being processed. You can also add a line debugger; and the browser will stop at this line so you can inspect the variables and watch your code. For now, we strongly recommend to use Formulas as pure functions, but with experience the recommendation may change.

Alternatively you can dynamically write your JavaScript. Here's how you can do it using Razor (Example from the Blueimp Gallery): <div id=\"blueimp-gallery-items-@Dnn.Module.ModuleID\" style=\"display:none;\"> <!-- stuff --> </div> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> $(document).ready(function () { // initialize the carousel gallery blueimp.Gallery($('[data-gallery=\"#blueimp-gallery-@Dnn.Module.ModuleID\"]').get(), { container: '#blueimp-gallery-@Dnn.Module.ModuleID', carousel: true } ); }); </script> The example above will replace @Dnn.Modul.ModuleID on the server with the module instance id, so each use on the same page will result in another unique ID."

This is all done in HTML / JavaScript. How to use The most common use-case is actually to provide some HTML, which the JavaScript will pick up automatically and convert into a menu. You can read more about this in Html Toolbars and Buttons. You can also generate the html as needed - for example when working with a javascript template in AngularJS, React, Ember etc. Here's a small example: var btnHtml = $2sxc(740).manage.getButton({ action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\" }); var toolbarHtml = $2sxc(740).manage.getToolbar({ action: \"new,edit,add\", entityId: 203 }); So this is really it. There are only two commands you must know: ...getButton(...) ...getToolbar(...) The rest of the magic lies in the configuration objects which you pass into these buttons. So let's continue with that. A Deeper Look Inside the System The following terms help you understand what we're doing: 2sxc has many commands like new, edit etc. which you can run with parameters like: command = { action: 'new', contentType: 'BlogPost'}; a button will run such a command when clicked, but for it to work, the button must have the command ready, including the necessary parameters. In JavaScript a button is defined like: btn = { command: { action: \"...\", ...}, icon: \"...\", ... }; and will later be converted to HTML like <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Dummy\"})'>new</a> a button group is an array of buttons, plus some shared specs like group = { buttons: [ { command: ...}, { }, { }], defaults: {...}, ... }; this will later be converted to a list of <li> nodes containing buttons a toolbar contains an array of button groups and again some shared specs / defaults, like toolbar = { groups: [ ... ], defaults: ...}; which will also be converted to the list of <li> nodes, but shows only one group at a time until the user presses a more button The full object tree of a toolbar is fairly sophisticated, and in most cases you can use shorthands which will be expanded internally before use. So you'll write // this is what you would normally write var toolbar = { action: \"new,edit,sort\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 2 }; // which internally expands to this: var toolbar = { groups: [{ buttons: [{ title: \"Toolbar.New\", command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\" }, icon: \"icon-sxc-plus\", addCondition: true, // more stuff here },{ title: \"Toolbar.Edit\", command: { action: \"edit\", useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 2 }, icon: \"icon-sxc-pencil\", addCondition: true, // more stuff here }, { // etc. }] }] } In most cases you just care about the shorthand. But in advanced cases where you really want to affect the behavior, you may go want to go deeper. Buttons and Commands Buttons are explained in more details here Commands which run when a button is pressed are here Custom commands which run your JS are here Button group This is just a simple object containing an array of buttons and some more settings which are rarely used and not documented yet. var group = { name: \"...\", buttons: \"...\", defaults: { // ... } }; var group2 = { buttons: [ { action: \"new\" }, { action: \"edit\", icon: \"icon-sxc-bomb\" }, \"button3\", { title: \"hello there\", command: { action: \"new\", } } ], defaults: { // todo } } Toolbar and Toolbar Configuration The toolbar can be defined very precisely, but in most cases you will opt for a short format which is expanded internally. Let's look at it: // very compact version var tb1 = { action: \"new,edit,moveup\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", entityId: 17 }; // array version var tb2 = [{ button1 }, { button2 }] // very expanded edition var tb2 = { groups: [ { name: \"group 1\", buttons: \"new,edit,more\" }, { name: \"group 2\", buttons: \"moveup,movedown,more\" } ], defaults: { contentType: \"BlogPost\", //... } }; Toolbar settings You can customize hover behavior, show behavior and more. Read about it in the toolbar settings. Custom Buttons with Custom Commands You can easily create custom buttons with custom icons, parameters and even custom scripts.

    "keywords": "Toolbar Button Definitions you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .edit-custom { visibility: visible; } When you create custom buttons in a floating toolbar you can customize everything including the icon and more. This is explained here. Warning Old Complicated Stuff This is old complicated stuff which you shouldn't need any more. We left it in the docs because we're not sure if some people still use this. But we strongy urge you not to use it, and use the simple toolbar APIs instead. Buttons are of html, basically a <a click=\"...\">[some-icon]</a>. When the button is created, it must already know what it's for, which is why the command must be prepared when the button is created. How to use A short example of a slightly customized button definition: var btns = [{ command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Category\" }, title: \"create Category\" }, { command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Author\" }, title: \"create Author\" }]; This simple example shows two new buttons creating different kinds of things, and we customized the label so the mouse-over would tell the editor which button is which. Let's get a bit more sophisticated var btn = { command: { // some command here }, icon: \"icon-sxc-code\", title: \"this is my special button\", classes: \"redButton\", }; The above example shows all than can currently be configured one a button. And here's a much more complex example. This is the full object-structure which the button generator getButton(...) understands: // full version var btn = { title: \"some title - ideally from translation table\", icon: \"some icon like icon-sxc-bomb\", command: { action: \"some action name like new\", moreParamsAsNeeded: \"...\" }, showCondition: someValueOr function(itemSettings) { return true; }, classes: \"btn-xyz my-class\", dynamicClasses: function(itemSettings) { if( (new Date()).getDay() === 1 ) return \"color-monday\"; } }; // typically more compact edition (will be expanded at runtime) var btn2 = { title: \"my button!\", icon: \"icon-sxc-list\", action: \"layout\" }; // or the totally compact edition var btn3 = \"layout\"; Some functioning code You may wonder how to actually use this. Here's an JSON example: <p class=\"sc-element\"> mouse over this to see inline-json version <ul class=\"sc-menu\" data-toolbar='[{ \"command\": { \"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Category\" }, \"title\": \"create Category\" }, { \"command\": { \"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Author\" }, \"title\": \"create Author\" }]'></ul> </p> Here's a more sophisticated (but also more reusable) example: <p class=\"sc-element\"> mouse over this to see the js toolbar generated by the buttons-list <toolbars2Buttons></toolbars2Buttons> </p> <script> var toolbars2Buttons = [{ command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Category\" }, title: \"create Category\" }, { command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Author\" }, title: \"create Author\" }]; // note that we cannot create the toolbars before the page-onready. Because of this // our code which creates the toolbar must be delayed, like in a $(our-code); $(function(){ if(typeof $2sxc != \"undefined\") // continue if $2sxc exists; it may be missing in non-edit modes $(\"toolbars2Buttons\").each(function(index, element){ var controller = $2sxc(element); if(!controller.isEditMode()) // check if this specific module currently allows editing return; var toolbar = controller.manage.getToolbar(toolbars2Buttons); $(element).replaceWith(toolbar); }); }); </script> How it works Buttons are used in toolbars all the time, and before they are rendered, the must be fully configured/expanded, as shown in the larger example. Internally the button is built with whatever is given, and anything not defined yet is automatically filled with the defaults. The defaults are taken from the commands definitions. Here's how the get defaults works: if all that is knows about a button is the name like var btn = \"new\", then it gets all the configuration from the defaults if some properties are known, like var btn = { command: {action: \"new\"}, icon: \"myicon\" }, then only the missing properties are taken from the defaults. Note that retrieving defaults requires the button to know which command it's for, so the name of the command is essential. The Button Properties object command the internal command which will be called, should contain both the name and the parameters like { action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\"} see also commands string icon a css class giving the button the icon. It can be one of the icons 2sxc provides, or it can be your own - just be sure to include a CSS & font which resolves the icon string title a text which is shown on mouse-over. Note that 2sxc will try to run it through the translator, so you can also use placeholders like Toolbar.Metadata string classes comma separated list of class-names like makeRed,glowHover function dynamicClasses(settings) can be used to dynamically build classes depending on the situation bool/function showCondition (API still experimental) - used to dynamically choose if this button should be shown or not bool disabled (API still experimental) would disable the click on a button bool partOfPage (API still experimental, new in 2sxc 9.5) determines if resulting changes should effect the Evoq/Dnn Page Publishing - note that it only effects the page-lifecyle, if the resulting dialogs and APIs respect this setting Some more Notes Because the button is often passed around as plain text/html, it can't rely on hidden variables to keep track of anything. This is why the onclick is so verbose, like onclick=\"$2sxc(4030).manage.run({\"action\": \"edit\", \"entityId\": 42 }). This is to ensure it always survives the text-round-trip.

We suggest you don't use them any more! How to Use v9.40 (old, not recommended) The most common use-case is actually to provide some HTML, which the JavaScript will pick up automatically and convert into a menu. The syntax was revised in 2sxc 9.40+, which is what we show here. The previous syntax is still supported, but not recommended any more: <!-- this is the default toolbar for first content item assigned to this module --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": {\"sortOrder\":0,\"useModuleList\":true} }'> </div> <!-- this is a toolbar for a content-item with the id 6875 --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": {\"entityId\":6875} }'> </div> <!-- this could be a custom toolbar for showing a new-button only --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": {\"contentType\":\"BlogPost\",\"action\":\"new\"} }'> </div> <!-- this would have two buttons, each configured in a way --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": [{ \"action\":\"edit\", \"useModuleList\":true, \"sortOrder\": 0, \"prefill\": { \"DocumentedOnPage\": \"page:@Dnn.Tab.TabID\", \"title\": \"@Dnn.Tab.Title\" } }, { \"action\" : \"new\", \"contentType\" : \"BlogPost\" }] }'> </div> What was Changed/Enhanced in 2sxc 9.40 There were some things which worked well, but bothered us as perfectionists :). It boils down to how much of the page html must be different just because editing is used. So this is what we wanted to change: the previous implementation always used a special class sc-element to mark the tag which detects mouse-over. This was necessary, because the tag itself was added in another place in the code. This is not necessary any more, since the sxc-toolbar attribute is now on the tag which does the hover-detect. the previous implementation created a <ul> tag in the source code. Though this was not a big issue, it just didn't feel right. the previous implementation spread the information for the toolbar on two attributes toolbar and settings - this just wasn't perfect. Now it's both in the sxc-toolbar attribute. How to Use before 2sxc 9.40 <!-- this is the default toolbar for content assigned to this module --> <ul class=\"sc-menu\" toolbar='{\"sortOrder\":0,\"useModuleList\":true,\"isPublished\":true}'></ul> <!-- this is a default toolbar for content-items not assigned to this module --> <ul class=\"sc-menu\" toolbar='{\"isPublished\":true,\"entityId\":6875}'></ul> <!-- this could be a custom toolbar for showing a new-button only --> <ul class=\"sc-menu\" toolbar='{\"contentType\":\"BlogPost\",\"action\":\"new\"}'></ul> <!-- this would have two buttons, each configured in a way --> <ul class='sc-menu' toolbar='[{ \"action\":\"edit\", \"useModuleList\":true, \"sortOrder\": 0, \"prefill\": { \"DocumentedOnPage\": \"page:@Dnn.Tab.TabID\", \"title\": \"@Dnn.Tab.Title\" } }, { \"action\" : \"new\", \"contentType\" : \"BlogPost\" }]'></ul> How it Works Internally, a lot will happen to actually turn that into a real, usually floating, toolbar. Basically what happens is a script picks up all cases of <* sxc-toolbar=...> and <ul class=\"sc-menu ...\"></ul> it will then pass it to a toolbar creator which will either create a standard-list of buttons, or a custom one the resulting buttons/links will be placed in <li> items and added to the <ul> tag But you could also do a whole lot more, including custom buttons and code (since 2sxc 08.06) <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": { \"groups\": [ { \"name\": \"my default list\", \"buttons\": \"edit,add,more\" }, { \"name\": \"list buttons\", \"buttons: \"sort,moveup,movedown,more\" }, { \"name\": \"really advanced stuff\", \"buttons\": [ \"app\", \"zone\", { \"command\":{ \"action\": \"custom\", \"customCode\": \"alert(&apos;hello&apos;)\" } \"icon\": \"icon-sxc-bomb\" }, \"more\" ] } ], \"defaults\": { \"entityId\": 740, \"contentType\": \"BlogPost\" } }}'> ... </div> All the configuration is in the sxc-toolbar attribute, which contains two main nodes: toolbar - see below settings - see Toolbar Settings In the old syntax (before 2sxc 9.40, using the <ul> tag, two attributes are handled toolbar or data-toolbar - see below settings or data-settings - see Toolbar Settings More Background The toolbar information is: an object with some properties (like entityId) and no action verbs --> then it will auto-generate all default buttons { entityId: 17, isPublished: true } an object with some properties and 1 or more action verbs --> generate only these buttons { actions: \"new,edit\", useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 1 } an array with commands (objects with 1 verb) --> generate these Buttons [{ action: ...}, { action: ...}] on object containing a buton-group like { buttons: [ { command: { action: ...}}, { command: ...}] } a group of button-groups [ { buttons: ... }, {buttons: ...}] a full toolbar configuration { groups: [...], defaults: {...}, params: {...} } For a full scope of what is possible, you should read the js toolbar documentation.

    "keywords": "How To Customize the Toolbars you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .edit-custom { visibility: visible; } A lot in 2sxc is fully automatic. But sometimes you want to customize how the content editor can work. Note 2sxc 10.27 introduces a much simpler system, which is what is shown here. Previously everything was possible, but quite complicated. So if you find examples out there which look very different - they work as well, but here's the simple system. Live Examples The Dnn Tutorials have a live demo of toolbar customization. Head over there while reading these docs to see all this in action. Overview - What You can Customize You can customize just about everything: hover-behavior - you may want hover, maybe not, and maybe to the right | left colors using color names, hex-codes or CSS classes of the entire toolbar or just of individual buttons you can just enhance/change the default toolbar or create a custom one with just your buttons you can change the button groups - add, remove etc. you can add/remove buttons as you need you can create buttons with custom icons you can even call custom code from your custom buttons Tip This overview will get you started, anything more advanced will need the specs button UI rules Important This will show you how to do things in Razor, but the same principles apply to plain HTML-Toolbars. We assume that 99% of all toolbars will be initiated from razor, so that's what we'll be showing here. Getting Started with Custom Toolbars Usually your code will look a bit like this: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> ... </div> This will create a standard hover-toolbar with some buttons and the more ellipsis button. Note that the exact combination of buttons is auto-detected. So you may just have an edit but you may also have an add etc. depending on the template and the data it receives. It looks approx. like this: Add our First Button Let's add an extra new button to create an item of the content-type Category. Note This code will make the button appear, but on click you may see an error, because you probably don't have a ContentType Category in your app. <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: \"+new?contentType=Category\")> ... </div> You should now have an extra + button like this: Let's emphasize it, because for whatever reason it's a super important button. We'll also drop the leading + since it's optional and defaulted to: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: \"new&color=red?contentType=Category\")> ... </div> You should now have a red + button like this: Important The term new in this example means we want a button of type new which will open the dialog to create new entities. We could also write app&color=red which would add a button to manage the app. So new ≠ 'new button' but 'button to add a new entity'. The full list of button names can be found in the CMS Commands list. Adding more Buttons Now we want to add another button - maybe to add a Tag. The toolbar attribute on the Edit.TagToolbar can take various kinds of objects, but for the new simple API it only accepts string objects or string[] arrays. So to make multiple changes to the toolbar, we'll have to give it a string[] array like this (note that we can use line-breaks, to make the code easier to read): <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { \"new&color=red?contentType=Category\", \"new&color=teal?contentType=Tag\" })> ... </div> You should now see this: Tip When creating new items you can also add prefill default values. This is great for News-Apps where you want to prefill the date or for list of something where you want to prefill the category. Check out the specs. Removing Buttons with - Now maybe you don't like to allow your editors to change the view - so let's do the same but remove the view-switch button as well using the remove - prefix: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { \"-layout\", \"new&color=red?contentType=Category\", \"new&color=teal?contentType=Tag\" })> ... </div> So you can add / remove any button you want. You can find a full list of button names (command names). Modifying Existing Buttons with % But what if we want to modify an existing button? Let's change the icon and both colors of the layout (view) button using the modify % prefix: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { \"%layout&icon=icon-sxc-replace&color=white,maroon\", \"new&color=red?contentType=Category\", \"new&color=teal?contentType=Tag\" })> ... </div> As you can see, we just used % to modify a button, set the icon and 2 colors. Show Only Our Buttons But maybe we would prefer to have a toolbar with only the two add buttons, and nothing else. By default, the toolbar uses a template called default which contains all these buttons. But you can always start with an empty template. You'll find the full list of templates here. <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { \"toolbar=empty\", \"new&color=red?contentType=Category\", \"new&color=teal?contentType=Tag\" })> ... </div> Tip As you can see, the principle is to use a toolbar template and make modifications to it. Showing the Delete Button Warning A special case in modifying buttons is also to force-show the delete button which is hidden by default. The reason it's hidden is because in most content-editing scenarios the editor should be able to remove content, but not delete it - in case it's re-used elsewhere. But let's say you created a News App and want to allow the editor to also delete the news-items. Here's how: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: \"%delete&show=true\")> ... </div> The delete button is in the third group of buttons, so you'll have to hit the ellipsis a few times to see it. You'll then see: Adding Custom Groups Let's assume you understand the principle of adding, removing and changing buttons. Let's add a custom button group with only the buttons you want - followed by the normal ellipsis-button with the standard functionality: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { \"group=add-buttons\", \"new&color=red&group=add-buttons?contentType=Category\", \"new&color=teal&group=add-buttons?contentType=Tag\" })> ... </div> You'll get this result, and hitting the ellipsis will show you the default buttons as you can see in the second image: Note We had to give our new group a name - in this case add-buttons and told the new buttons that they should go inside that group. Tip A new group can also go after the default group of buttons. If you add a &pos=1 or another number the group will be placed later on in the sequence. You can also use &pos=-0 or &pos=-1 or similar to place it counting from the end of the list. Warning When using position like pos=# you may have unexpected results, because the button is added to the list before some buttons decide to hide themselves. So you may think you're adding it to pos=1 but if the edit button (which would be at position 0) shouldn't be shown, your button will still appear to be the first one. There is also a hidden group called edit-advanced - you can find the list of groups here. As of now, it only contains the delete button which is hidden by default. Attaching Custom JavaScript Code to a Button Now you may want to call your own code when you create a button. This is very advanced stuff, but here's how: <div class=\"demobox\" @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: \"custom&title=Message?call=myMessage&id=17\") > This demonstrates a custom button with the call-name in the parameters. </div> <script> function myMessage(context, event) { console.log(context, event); alert('hello from my Message - got this id:' + context.button.command.params.id); } </script> You'll then see this toolbar, and on click this message: You'll notice that we have a ?call=functionName and also an id=17 just to show how additional information is passed around. Your function also gets an event from the browser, so you can check the event.target and other things to see what was actually clicked. Warning This is very advanced stuff, you may run into difficulties to get this to fly 😉. Debugging Custom Toolbars In most cases if your problems will be caused by invalid syntax. It's easy to forget a closing quote \" or a comma , to separate values. So always check that first. If you really want to do deep debugging, you should use the $2sxc.insights() command in the console to see what whas processed and how. If you add ?debug=true to the url of the page, it will also log way more intermediate data for you to review. Read More Basically you have what it takes.

These are the arguments we got.', wfArgs); return false; // Return false to stop this command from happening } }; // Attach event-listener to the TagToolbar parent, so we can register the workflow when the toolbar is created var parent = document.getElementById('tagWithToolbar1'); parent.addEventListener('toolbar-init', (initEvent) => { console.log(\"Workflow Demo: Tag Toolbar was initialized - event kicked in - will now register\"); const workflow = initEvent.detail.workflow; workflow.add(workflowToLog); workflow.add(workflowToDisableRefresh); // Stop the event here, otherwise parent elements which have an event listener would get triggered as well initEvent.stopPropagation(); }); How Workflows Work 👉 Learn more about Workflows How Toolbars Register the Workflows Each toolbar can have different workflows attached. The toolbars are generated on-the-fly and sometimes re-generated on partial reloading. So you must register your workflow-steps when the toolbar reports that it's ready. So this is the flow of logic: A toolbar is created - often on mouse-over It will fire a toolbar-init event contains a lot of internal information on the event.details and also a workflow object which is the Workflow Manager for this toolbar. Your code will pick up the event.details.workflow and then add(...) a workflow step - see Workflow Step Object probably call event.stopPropagation() or similar to prevent other event listeners from also adding stuff. This is especially important if you have entities within entities, in which case there may be listeners for each toolbar at various DOM levels. 👉 Learn more about Workflows TagToolbar workflows created using @Edit.TagToolbar(...) should attach the init-listener to that tag Toolbar workflows created using @Edit.Toolbar(...) should attach the init-listener to a parent tag Angular Implementation In dnn-sxc-angular there is a directive for toolbars, which hides all this and just allows you to do a custom refresh as you need it. See Toolbars in Angular (dnn-sxc-angular) React Implementation As of now, there is no pre-built React implementation, but you can easily create your own based on the angular version.

    "title": "turnOn JavaScript API | 2sxc 16 / EAV 16",
    "keywords": "turnOn JavaScript API The Problem turnOn Solves A core problem with all JavaScript is making sure that all scripts and dependencies are loaded, available and ready, and the data needed to init is available (usually in the Html itself). Even something as simple as this can fail... $(start); ...because even this example requires jQuery to already exist. turnOn solves this problem with a new architecture. Loading is now configuration based. No matter which parts load in what order, turnOn will work. Tip turnOn is also building an architecture which will reliably work even with very strict CSP enforced - which we believe will be essential in future. 👉 Check out the turnOn Tutorials Activate turnOn To use turnOn you must must tell the page that you need it. Here's how: var page = GetService<ToSic.Sxc.Services.IPageService>(); page.Activate(\"turnOn\"); 👉 Read more about the IPageService The turnOn Solution When using turnOn, the page will request the turnOn.js in any way. It can also be deferred. Then this will be used to turn-on your code: <div turn-on='{ \"await\": [\"window.$\"], \"run\": \"window.appContent.maps.load()\", \"data\": \"some-google-maps-key\" }'> <!-- more html --> </div> This is what happens The html will just be loaded and have no effects, throw no errors and nothing Once the turnOn.js loads it will find this and process it - it doesn't matter if turnOn was already loaded or deferred turnOn will then wait for all this to exist: window window.$ window.appContent window.appContent.maps window.appContent.maps.load It will then call window.appContent.maps.load(data) with the data provided Here's another example, taken from the new Content-App in 2sxc: <!-- Instruct turnOn to init this specific Map once everything is loaded --> <turnOn turn-on='{ \"run\": \"window.appContent.maps.configureMap()\", \"data\": { \"domId\": \"GoogleMap-@DynamicModel.mapId\", \"marker\": \"@Text.First(DynamicModel.markerImage, \"\")\", \"lat\": @DynamicModel.mapInfo.GpsLat.ToString(\"R\"), \"lng\": @DynamicModel.mapInfo.GpsLong.ToString(\"R\"), \"zoom\": @Content.Presentation.Zoom, \"info\": \"@DynamicModel.company\", \"warn\": @(Settings.GoogleMapsShowWarning ? \"true\" : \"false\") }}'></turnOn> This example will init a map with the configuration of the map incl. pin-image, coordinates and more. Signature of Run call The run method - in the above example ...configureMap() is as follows: public void configureMap(data) { // data is the data provided in the turnOn } 2sxc v14.02 includes turnOn v0.1.2, where the run method also has another parameter: context. The most important property is context.tag which is the tag which contained the configuration. This allows you to use $2sxc(context.tag) to get the Sxc of the tag. Advantages of Using turnOn Works, no matter in what order the scripts were loaded Works even if the HTML was created before or after loading the scripts Works for lazy-loaded HTML which can introduce new turnOn configurations Responsibility of Your Code There are a few things turnOn doesn't do, which you should be aware of: It doesn't load JS or CSS files (yet). As of now, you must still do this in the HTML template. The init code must still do it's work properly. If multiple inits should not be called, then your code must ensure that it detects this and skips multiple initializations. Your init-code should not auto-run when loading the script, as this could again be missing dependencies. Examples of the Full Challenge Common things which may be needed before the code starts: The main JS code Additional JS parts Some JS Libraries CSS DOM nodes which the JS should work on Configuration data like ModuleId which should be known. Dynamic pages make this even harder - like when Oqtane/Blazor reloads just parts of the page multiple times. We must ensure that the JS isn't re-initialized again and again, as that can cause issues like: The same code running in parallel - causing all sorts of damage Memory leaks where the same library and complex object states are loaded many times Issues where some code initialized and was then replaced by new, uninitialized code Our goal is to simplify this, so that your solution can simply state what it needs, and then run once all that has been provided. a dom node with a specific id like #module-57 an object on the window like window.someLibrary a js file which should be loaded if it's not loaded yet like /js/jquery.min.js a css file like /css/mycss.js History Added v0.1.1 in 2sxc v12.04 Updated to v0.1.2 in 2sxc v14.02 providing the context as the second parameter Future features also await certain DOM events; ATM you can do this easily after turnOn has run it's magic, but it would be nice to specify it in the config load scripts and js"

The simplest possible turnOn would be this: <em turn-on='{ \"run\": \"window.startSomething()\" }'></em> Longer name segments are automatically checked one by one, so this will also work reliably: <em turn-on='{ \"run\": \"window.appGallery.master.start()\" }'></em> Very often you'll then want to include data - either an identifier, a string or object: <em turn-on='{ \"run\": \"window.startMeaningOfLife()\", \"data\": \"42\" }'></em> <em turn-on='{ \"run\": \"window.startMeaningOfLife()\", \"data\": { \"answer\": \"42\", \"question\": null }'></em> In addition you can also specify one or more objects to wait for: <em turn-on='{ \"await\": [\"window.$\", \"window.fancybox\"], \"run\": \"window.appGallery.master.start()\" }'></em> You can also wait for a ready-check to exist and for it to return true: <em turn-on='{ \"await\": [\"window.appGallery.isReady()\"], \"run\": \"window.appGallery.master.start()\" }'></em> turnOn JSON Schema These are the properties you can set Property Type Comments await string[] Strings can be objects on window or functions to call for finding out if it's ready. run (req.) string The function to call once it exists data any data to give the run-command debug boolean will console-log what it's doing More on the await Property This is always a string array.

It will preserve the this if it's part of a larger object Debug turnOn In some cases you may not get what you expect and need to debug what you're doing. There are two options: To debug a specific turnOn just add the \"debug\": true to the JSON To debug everything in turnOn, set window.debugTurnOn = true; anywhere on the page. this will flood your console Common Problems The most common cause of issues is an invalid JSON. You'll get errors in the console if you do this. This is especially common if you add dynamic data from the CMS to the object, as it could contain \" characters which break the json. Another common problem is converting boolean C# values to inject into the JSON. Here's why: <!-- this will fail --> <span turn-on='{ \"run\": \"window.load()\", \"data\": { \"show\": Settings.Show }}'></span> <!-- will produce this --> <span turn-on='{ \"run\": \"window.load()\", \"data\": { \"show\": True }}'></span> <!-- this will work --> <span turn-on='{ \"run\": \"window.load()\", \"data\": { \"show\": @(Settings.Show ? \"true\" : \"false\") }}'></span> <!-- will produce this --> <span turn-on='{ \"run\": \"window.load()\", \"data\": { \"show\": true }}'></span> Allowed HTML Tags Any valid HTML tag can be used, incl. existing div or span tags which just get a turn-on attribute added. So you can use <em>, <div>, <span> or even <turnOn> There are a few cases where problems could arise though: If you use a <script> tag, this may not work as expected, as additional processing layers may do something with these script tags. This is especially important in Oqtane, as there the script tags are filtered out and treated separately. If you use a tag which you will later modify in HTML (like using jQuery or Angular) this may fail, because turnOn will make status-updates to the tag and this could interfere with your code doing updates as well.

    "keywords": "Convention: Functional API (Immutable) There are many programming paradigms. One that's become very important to us is functional programming. This means that code (usually functions) will have inputs and outputs, but no side effects. This also means that an object which must be modified will be copied into a new object, with the modifications applied. The original object is never modified. In most cases it will be discarded. This is strongly related to immutability Important This was not always our approach, so some of the code is still not functional. But you must assume that anything you find which is not functional, will be so in the future. Example This assumes code inside a Razor page, as it uses Kit.Toolbar // Create a toolbar with a single edit button var toolbar = Kit.Toolbar.Empty().Edit(); // Add a button to the toolbar var toolbarWithLayout = toolbar.Layout(); // Note that as of now, the original toolbar still only has the Edit button. This goes even further. In v15.07 the toolbar API was extended with features to make UI settings more robust: // Give an inner tweak function to set more properties var toolbar = Kit.Toolbar.Edit(tweak: b => b.Color(\"red\").Tooltip(\"Edit here\")); Why Functional? Functional programming has many advantages, but the most important one is that it's easier to test and debug. It's also easier to understand, because you can see the inputs and outputs of a function, without having to look at the code. In the end, the quality and robustness of our application is much better. Coverage - Parts of 2sxc which are Functional The Toolbar API on Kit.Toolbar is 100% functional (new v14) The Razor HTML Tags API on Kit.HtmlTags is 100% functional (new ca. v13) Page Parameters CmsContext.Page.Parameters are 100% functional (new ca. v12) Linking data sources using the Link property is 100% functional (new in v15) History Introduced gradually starting with 2sxc 12 RazorBlade started doing this in v3 also in 2sxc 13 Shortlink: https://go.2sxc.org/functional"

This is strongly related to functional APIs This means than objects inside 2sxc are never modified. Instead, they are copied and modified, and the original object is discarded. Example var original = new { Name = \"John\", Age = 42 }; var modified = SomeService.ChangeAge(original, 43); var areEqual = original.Age == modified.Age; // false Use in DataSources A common place where this affects Razor and WebApis is when using DataSources. Old data sources could do this: var entityFilter = CreateSource<EntityIdFilter>(); entityFilter.EntityIds = \"123,456\"; var data = entityFilter.List; This behavior still works on old data sources to ensure compatibility. But newer DataSources such as AppFiles will not allow this, and will throw an exception if you try to modify the properties. They are immutable. Instead, you must do this: var appFiles = CreateSource<AppFiles>(options: new { OnlyFolders = true }); // The following would throw an error: // appFiles.OnlyFolders = true; var data = appFiles.List; This new way is the only recommended way of doing this from now on. Coverage As of March 2023, ca. 80% of all objects in 2sxc are immutable, we hope to reach 95% by end of 2023. We cannot reach 100% any time soon, because we must ensure compatibility with existing code. IEntity is internally 98% immutable - some details left to optimize DataSources can be immutable.

    "keywords": "Convention: MyServices 2sxc and EAV prefer to use Composition over Inheritance. But in some cases this is not possible, and we need to use inheritance. The problem that then arises is that the base class needs services, and the list of services can change with time. This would make it very hard to keep inherited objects working, as upgrades would break the constructor. So we invented a special convention. Here's how it works: Basic Setup This is what a typical base class would look like public abstract class ExampleBase { // Public ExampleBase.MyServices which actually gets all the dependencies public class MyServices { public MyServices(/* dependencies */) { // ... } } // The normal constructor of ExampleBase, asking for these services protected ExampleBase(MyServices services) { // ... } } This class is then registered with normal DI and just works. Inheritance When you inherit such a class, this is what you do: public class YourClass : ExampleBase { public YourClass(MyServices services, ISomeOtherService xyz) : base(services) { // ... } } When you do this (assuming you registered your YourClass) in DI, it will automatically use the MyServices from the base class. This way the base class can change the list of it's dependencies as it needs, while preserving a constructor that never changes. Good to Know Internally the system does quite a bit more, but this is all you need to know to get it to work 😉. Note You may be tempted to use something which is available on MyServices. But you shouldn't as this is a private API and may change at any time. Use in DataSources The most common place for you to see this is when creating custom DataSources. You will usually inherit from CustomDataSource. It too has a MyServices class. Coverage As of March 2023, all DataSources use this convention. Many other objects use this as well, but we don't expect that you'll be needing that. History Introduced in 2sxc 15 Shortlink: https://go.2sxc.org/myservices"

    "title": "Convention: Named Parameters | 2sxc 16 / EAV 16",
    "keywords": "Convention: Named Parameters When working with the C# / Razor API, advanced/optional parameters must be named. Tip A named parameter is determined by it's name (eg settings:), like SomeMethod(settings: someValue) vs. a positional parameter which is specified by the position in the list of arguments, like SomeMethod(someValue). Example @inherits Custom.Hybrid.RazorTyped @* this is a command without named parameters - all works *@ @MyItem.Picture(\"Packshot\") @* this is a command with named parameters for more advanced settings *@ @MyItem.Picture(\"Packshot\", settings: \"Lightbox\") @* this is a command with named parameters for exact width control *@ @MyItem.Picture(\"Packshot\", width: 500) @* An example using both parameters in any order *@ @MyItem.Picture(\"Packshot\", settings: \"Lightbox\", width: 500) @MyItem.Picture(\"Packshot\", width: 500, settings: \"Lightbox\") The previous example shows A Razor inheriting from Custom.Hybrid.RazorTyped to enable the new MyItem.Picture(...) API A add-picture with only the basic parameter. This doesn't need the name as the position (first parameter) makes it clear that Packshot is the field containing the picture A more advanced use case where the picture uses settings: \"Lightbox\" (this must be named with settings: ...) Another use case where the picture uses width: 500 (named with width: ...) Two more examples specifying multiple parameters - showing that the order is not important since we have the names As you can see in the settings: and width: example, both of these parameters are on the second position. If they were not named, the API wouldn't know if 500 or Lightbox was a width, setting or anything else. Example using Toolbars This means that a command like this is valid <!-- valid --> <div @Edit.TagToolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\")> ... </div> <!-- not valid --> <div @Edit.TagToolbar(\"new\", \"BlogPost\")> ... </div> Reason Behind Named Parameters We often have APIs which start simple - like @Edit.TagToolbar() and continue to receive new features. At first, the parameter order will make sense - for that simple use case. But as the API grows, the parameter-order will become strange, simply because we would have to order them in the sequence they were added (to keep compatibility) and not in the order that makes sense. By using named parameters, we're making sure that the parameter order never matters and the API stays stable/compatible for the future. Not all Parameters Require Names Because of historic reasons and because some APIs simply have a very obvious first or second parameter, it may be that the first 1-2 parameters are not named. An example is @Edit.TagToolbar(Content) which assumes that the first parameter without name is the item (entity) for which this toolbar is meant. How It's Implemented Internally the real signature of the command uses a parameter which has a fairly random value. The call then checks if the value of that parameter is this random value, and if not, shows an error. This is to protect you from accidentally using the command without naming the parameters. Note: you could of course work around this, by providing that random value and trick the call to accept unnamed parameters. Don't do this - as we will no guarantee that the API signature (parameter order) will stay the same. History Introduced ca. in 2sxc 6 Shortlink: https://go.2sxc.org/named-params"

    "keywords": "Convention: Property Required Name Checks On newer APIs we implement a policy that properties are required by default (but you can override this). This applies to newer base classes such as RazorPro ApiPro CodePro This means that by default, retrieving any property such as something.String(\"FirstName\") will only work, if the underlying Entity has the property FirstName. Otherwise it will throw an error. Why? This should help you find errors earlier, and make your code more stable. Previously when using dynamic objects, it was easy to make a typo and not notice it, or to be using the wrong object (such as having and underlying BlogPost object instead of a Category object). How to Override You can override this at object/wrapper creation, or when retrieving the value. When creating the object, you can override the default behavior by setting the TODO: parameter. Example: var lax = AsItem(someEntity, propsRequired: false); var willBeNull = lax.String(\"DoesNotExist\"); When accessing a property, you can override it by using the required parameter. Example: var willBeNull = MyItem.String(\"DoesNotExist\", required: false); Tip The required parameter is a nullable boolean. This is to ensure that it's clear if you set it or not, in which case the default will be used. Behavior when providing a fallback value Most methods which have a required also have a fallback parameter. This is a value which will be returned if the property is empty or is not populated. So there is a slightly different behavior. When using it on data-object such as ITypedItem the fallback does not change the behavior of required. So if you don't change required, and the field doesn't exist, it will throw an error. When using the MyModel the fallback will also affect the required. So if you specify a fallback which can be distinguished from the default (eg. not a null on a string, not a false on a bool) then required will be ignored and the fallback will be returned.

Here's how it works: The code which actually does work is called the Real controller and it's code is in ToSic.Sxc.WebApi or ToSic.Eav.WebApi The platform has the surface Proxy controller which just ensures that the endpoint is available on that platform Note This concept is still being developed in v13 so it's not final.

Once all controllers are built this way, they will probably be renamed just to ...Controller The Proxy Controller Each platform and integration will just have the minimal Proxy Controller which has the following functions: Make the endpoint available on this platform, on the correct address Ensure basic endpoint security as the platform does it (like ensure authentication, etc.) Forward all calls to the Real controller In rare cases, convert data which is treated differently on that platform to the format the Real Controller expects.

This is the classic way of doing things. It's more complicated than the new Dynamic DataSources but has a few advantages. Note that for most projects today, we recommend you use the Dynamic DataSources instead. It's important to note that Compiled DataSources have a much tighter integration with 2sxc/EAV. This often means that on major upgrades, you may need to update / adjust your code a bit. Here is a very simple example of a compiled DataSource: using System; using ToSic.Eav.Data.Build; using ToSic.Eav.DataSource; using ToSic.Eav.DataSource.VisualQuery; namespace ToSic.Tutorial.DataSources { // This `[VisualQuery]` Attribute provides info so the visual query can provide the correct buttons and infos // There are ca. 20 possible settings [VisualQuery( // The nice title to show in Visual Query NiceName = \"TodayInfos (Tutorial)\", // The name of the icon - from the google fonts Icon = \"today\", // A very unique ID - make sure you get a fresh one for each data source // for example from https://guidgenerator.com/ NameId = \"7aee541c-7188-429f-a4bb-2663a576b19e\" )] public class TodayInfos: CustomDataSource { /// <summary> /// Constructor to tell the system what out-streams we have. /// /// Note that the base class needs certain Dependencies, which are all wrapped in the Dependencies type. /// This allows for a stable API even if future base classes require more dependencies. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"services\">The dependencies required by the base class</param> public TodayInfos(MyServices services): base(services, \"My.Basic\") { // \"Default\" out; when accessed, will deliver GetListWithToday ProvideOut(GetListWithToday, options: () => new DataFactoryOptions(titleField: \"Date\")); } /// <summary> /// Get-List method, which will load/build the items once requested /// Note that the setup is lazy-loading so this code will only execute when used /// </summary> private object GetListWithToday() { // These are the values which the Entity will have // It uses a very simple anonymous object return new { Date = DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString(), Weekday = DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek, DayOfWeek = (int)DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek }; } } } Differences to Dynamic DataSources The main difference is that the Dynamic DataSource is compiled into a DLL. As such it is available on all Apps on that installation and can/must be distributed separately. It's also harder to create and maintain. 💡 Complied DataSources should inherit from CustomDataSource Advantages Develop in Visual Studio Can be used in any App on that installation Compiles to DLL and therefor you will detect code issues faster Can be unit tested it's ideal for large, sophisticated code Disadvantages More difficult to maintain It's more likely to need adjustments on major 2sxc changes Every change/test requires a restart of the website Comparable both can be used in VisualQuery both can be used in Razor and WebApi Get Started First you should start with Dynamic DataSources and the live samples in our Dynamic DataSources Tutorials Then you should try to create your own 😉 Ideally check out the sample Tutorial Basic Discover More in the Razor Tutorials We have an rich series of Razor tutorials.

Here we'll explain how you must code your DataSource that it can be configurable. 1. Create Typed Properties For each piece of configuration your DataSource expects you should expose a normal property which will have that value. Internally it should get the data from the Configuration object which is an IDataSourceConfiguration. Here's an example from the ValueFilter: /// <summary> /// The attribute whose value will be scanned / filtered. /// </summary> [Configuration] public string Attribute => Configuration.GetThis(); /// <summary> /// The comparison operator, == by default, many possibilities exist /// depending on the original types we're comparing /// </summary> [Configuration(Fallback = \"==\")] public string Operator => Configuration.GetThis(); Remember that if the type is not string, you'll have to add some type-checking and fallbacks, since the Configuration object only works with strings to handle Tokens. Fortunately the new v16 API does this automatically for you. Here's an example from the AppFiles.cs [Configuration(Fallback = false)] public bool OnlyFolders => Configuration.GetThis(false); 2. Use the Value With this setup, everything is automatic. So if your code now does this: var x = Operator; ...it will get the parsed token with either the value provided by the config, or the fallback. Important In the constructor the Configuration object is not yet populated, so you can't use the properties there. So make sure it's accessed later, typically inside the function or lambda which is called by ProvideOut. History General Tokens introduced in 2sxc 1.0 Most enhancements were in 2sxc 07.00 2sxc 10 and 11 changed the Configuration API to better separate the Configuration Manager 2sxc 15/16 changed this completely using the new [Configuration] attribute and Configuration.GetThis()"

To enable this we create a Content-Type for each DataSource which will contain the fields to configure it. Example Let's say we need a Weather DataSource which must be configured. We would create a DataSource with these fields: CountryCode - text field with a dropdown of country codes ZipCode - text field to enter the ZIP code ApiKey - a key which will let our backend use the WeatherService Once this Content-Type is defined, we automatically have an editing-UI (thanks to the CMS features) but it's not yet connected to the DataSource. Easiest Way: Dynamic DataSources 🆕 v16 When using Dynamic DataSources (new in v16) it is fully automatic. Just create a ContentType with the same name as the DataSource + Configuration. So if your DataSource is called MySource, call the ContentType MySourceConfiguration. If for any reason you need to give it a different name, you can do this by using the VisualQuery Attribute. Basic Integration: Single-App Use If you don't plan on distributing your DataSource and only need it in one or two Apps, then you can just create the Content-Type there and export/import it to other apps. You'll need to register the internal name in the VisualQuery Attribute of your DataSource so that the UI will show the configuration where it's needed. Once you've done this, the VisualQuery Designer will know about it and offer your content-type when configuring that part of a Query. Tip The data entered will be made available to your DataSource Configuration as the MyConfiguration. Advanced Integration: Multi-App Use If you plan on using this configuration in many Apps on a server, then export/import of this Content-Type is not practical. In this case you'll want to export the Content-Type as a JSON and place it in the App_Data/system-custom/contenttypes folder for Global Content-Types. If you now restart your Dnn, then this new Content-Type is picked up and available in all Apps on this Dnn. Redistribution Scenario The above example works well if you're fine with installing the JSON Content-Type manually on servers which will use the DataSource. For more advanced redistribution, you'll want to include the JSON file in your Dnn Installation package. But in that case it's not in App_Data/system-custom so 2sxc/EAV can't pick it up. To make sure that it's still available to all Apps on a server, you'll need to create a special class to register it on Start of Dnn. All you have to do is create a public class which inherits ToSic.Eav.Repositories.FolderBasedRepository. On boot all these classes will be found and asked for other folders which have such data. Here's an example: using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Web; using ToSic.Eav.Repositories; namespace ToSic.Tutorial.DataSource.Basic { /// <summary> /// This class will be picked up by 2sxc/EAV at boot. /// It will tell it where there are additional Content-Types to load. /// See also https://docs.2sxc.org/basics/data/content-types/range-global.html /// </summary> public class RegisterGlobalContentTypes : FolderBasedRepository { public override List<string> RootPaths => new List<string> { HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(\"~/DesktopModules/ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SharePoint/App_Data\") }; } } Tip Remember that the folder (in this case App_Data) is not where the shared Content-Types are stored. They must be placed in a contenttypes subfolder. History General Tokens introduced in 2sxc 1.0 Most enhancements were in 2sxc 07.00"

In both cases they may need some configuration. When used in code, the code will look a bit like this: var withConfig = Kit.Data.GetSource(name: \"WithConfig\", parameters: new { AmountOfItems = 3, FavoriteColor = \"dark blue\" }); When used in VisualQuery, the developer will specify the configuration in the UI, and the Query system will automatically transfer all the values to the DataSource. How It Works For all of this to work, there is a robust Configuration System. Here's how it works in summary: All properties of a DataSource which are part of the configuration are decorated using the Configuration Attribute When the object is created, the class is scanned for these attributes and a internal dictionary of all configuration values is created These configurations use Tokens - so internally it will be something like AmountOfItems = [MyConfiguration:AmountOfItems||3] If code set a new value, the token is flushed and the new value is set If a query is used, then the token part [MyConfiguration:AmountOfItems] returns what was in the data If no value is set, the fallback value is used, since [MyConfiguration:AmountOfItems] doesn't return anything The foundation of this is built using: The Configuration Attribute and an internal loader The Configuration manager on the DataSource which helps you get the configuration The LookUp Engine which resolves any Tokens in the configuration For it to work in VisualQuery, it also needs: A Content-Type with fields matching the property names The VisualQuery Attribute on your DataSource which references that Content-Type The internal Query Engine which provides the data on the lookup called MyConfiguration Examples of Configurations Needed a Paging needs to know what page size it should use and what page it's on A CSV Data Source needs to know what file it should load a CmsBlock needs to know the module ID an Owner-Filter DataSource needs to know who the current user is, to find his items Some of this information depends on the current context (ModuleId, UserId), others on configured settings (page size) and some on Url-parameters (Page number). In addition, we sometimes want to say \"use the page-size configured in the App-Settings\" or even more complex \"use from url, but if not specified, try app-settings, and if that isn't defined, use 10\". How to Build a Configurable DataSource 👉 Best check the Dynamic DataSources Tutorials for some easy examples Configuration Basics Each configuration value of a DataSource must be a value (string, int etc.). But to allow greater flexibility in configuration, it usually starts as a string Token like [MyConfiguration:PageNumber]. This token is parsed before any data is queried using Configuration.GetThis() to convert the Token to the expected value type. Best read more about Tokens and how fallbacks, defaults and recursion work. The Tokens allow quite some fancy features: Your DataSource will use [MyConfiguration:...] tokens and will automatically get the settings as they were added in the UI Since tokens also allow for default/fallback values, your code will often have [MyConfiguration:Id||0] As tokens are recursive, the admin can specify things like [QueryString:Id||752] in the UI and your code (asking for [MyConfiguration:Id]) will get the ID from the URL or the default 752 as the Admin specified it. Thanks to Token Stacking a lot more is possible 😉 When a DataSource is configured, it has many parameter LookUp Sources like Module, QueryString, App etc. These are shared and are identical for all objects. Read more about the LookUp Sources. In your code you will usually not use these sources, but only use the MyConfiguration source. This source only exists in C# and contains all the values the Admin/Editor entered in the Configuration-UI. So the token [MyConfiguration:PageNumber] will deliver the number or text in the input-field pagenumber. How Tokens are Defined, Settings Edited and Resolved When you're using the VisualQuery designer, the configuration created is saved as an Entity (aka Content-Item) which must be injected into the DataSource configuration automatically. But when you use the object is your code, your code must be able to provide other values. But how does this work? Each DataSource object has a property called Configuration which is a dictionary containing all configuration properties the data source will care about. For example, the EntityIdFilter has a Configuration with only one property which is called EntityIds. The each property is first initialized with a Token-Template. This happens through the [Configuration] attribute. For example, the Csv DataSource has a [Configuration(Fallback = \"\\t\")] This says that the delimiter should come from the Settings-Entity field Delimiter and if not provided, fall back to \\t (which is a tab character) For the programmer who wants to set a number or whatever, this would be fairly unreliable to access from outside, so the DataSource should also have a real property which internally also modifies the dictionary. For example, the Csv DataSource has a string-property Delimiter which internally will get/set the in the Configuration dictionary. When the DataSource is first sucked from, which happens when something tries to access the Out-Property, it will automatically run a token-engine to resolve the values, then run whatever action the data-source wants. So how does each scenario work out? If the programmer overwrote the Delimiter property, then internally the Configuration[\"Delimiter\"] is now not a token any more, but instead just a character like ,. So the token-engine won't change anything. If the programmer didn't do anything but the VisualQuery engine gave a settings-entity to the system, then the token is resolved and whatever the user entered is used. if the neither the programmer nor the user provided settings, then the token-engine will resolve to the fallback and use the \\t as was defined.

Data and Streams in DataSources Every data-item is an IEntity containing data about a person, product, file-information etc. A list of these items is a IEnumerable<IEntity> which contains zero, one or many items A Stream is an object which has list of items and a name A correctly built Stream will Provide this list, but only run the code if it's requested Each DataSource has one or more named Out streams (the default is Default, others can have any name you want) Very advanced DataSources can have a dynamic list of Out Streams - like the App, which has a stream for each ContentType in the App Each DataSource can have one or more named In streams coming from other DataSources (usually the first one is called Default) Building Data / Entities DataSources use ProvideOut to determine what Streams are provided The parameter of ProvideOut is a function which returns a list of items so it's either ProvideOut(FunctionName) or ProvideOut(() => { ... }) The code of each ProvideOut is only run if the Stream is requested Different Base Classes have different ProvideOut signatures accepting different kinds of data The most basic base class only accepts functions returning IEnumerable<IEntity> Easier base classes accept any of IEnumerable<IEntity>, IEnumerable<RawEntity>, IEnumerable<AnonymousType> or even a single item (not an IEnumerable) Internally the data will always be converted to an IEnumerable<IEntity> so that it can be used by other DataSources When using the easier base classes, the conversion is done automatically You can also configure how the conversion works using options: new DataFactoryOptions(...) (see DataFactoryOptions) In very advanced cases you can also convert it to IEntity yourself, but this is not documented Generated IEntities can also have Relationships - like folders to files and visa versa This is not yet documented, but if you need this, check out the AppFiles DataSource Receiving Data from In for further processing If your DataSource performs filtering or similar actions on existing data, then this data comes in on the In streams. In such scenarios, you would simply iterate over the In[streamname].List and provide the result in your out-stream again. You can find many examples in the EAV DataSources code. TODO: Connections / Links When DataSources are attached to each other, they are connected by one or more Links Only the downstream DataSource (the one with the In) knows about the connection, the upstream DataSource (the one with the Out) doesn't know about it Data from connections are only accessed when necessary The links are also important for caching, since often caching depends on Upstream refreshes Links use an immutable Fluid API, but this is not yet documented TODO: Configuration of a DataSource DataSource classes can have many properties like int AmountToGet, bool IncludeDeleted etc. which change their behavior There is a Configuration System which automates how such configurations are passed to the DataSource To connect the Properties with the Configuration System you need the ConfigurationAttribute and Configuration.GetThis() - see Configurable DataSource Each DataSource has an own ConfigurationProvider, which gives the DataSource information about the environment (like Portal or Tab information), App-Settings and more The reason why each one has an own ConfigurationProvider is because each DataSource can have own configurations Each DataSource can have custom Configuration provided by code or entered by the user in VisualQuery Configurations are always string based since they use Tokens. Keep this in mind when you need int or bool, because conversions can fail, which is why Configuration.GetThis(fallback) has a fallback parameter - see ConfigurationProvider Tokens always use LookUp Sources so you should read about them Configuration in VisualQuery When you use a DataSource in VisualQuery, you can configure it by clicking the cogwheel This is only available if the DataSource has a VisualQuery Attribute mentioning the ConfigurationType or if it's a Dynamic DataSource which automatically can find the configuration ContentType If the user edited data, internally it's stored as an IEntity object, which is then passed to the DataSource as a configuration Usually the fields in the UI are all string based, even for numbers and bool, because the user may want to use Tokens Caching DataSources also have cache-identity mechanism, to inform any up-stream cache what parameters actually caused this result, so that the data could be cached if needed Configurations are taken into account when caching, so that the cache for AmountToGet=5 is different from AmountToGet=10 History This document mentions too many different aspects of the system, so no detailed history is given here."

Step 3: Learn the Big Picture 💡 You should read through the Big Picture of DataSources Step 4: Create your first Dynamic DataSources Now that you have seen the live tutorials, you should create a few Dynamic DataSources. You should not start with Compiled DataSources. They are much more difficult, and each failed try requires a rebuild, redeploy and restart of the website - with takes a long time. Step 4: Deepen your Understanding If you got this far and would like to go even deeper, this is what you probably need: how to provide data in different streams and different data types how to build entities with different property types and relationships as well as RawEntity objects advanced configuration possibilities use data from In streams, both the Default as well as other streams error handling Step 5: Create Compiled DataSources (optional) Only do this if you really need to, because it's much more complex and requires a lot of knowledge about the internals of the EAV. The guide stops here, but you can continue on Compiled DataSources.

The ConfigMask is part of the Configuration System and initializes a configuration value. This value will later be used for Parsing Tokens to find the correct parameter to use Use as part of the Cache-Key for high-performance caching. This ensures that DataSources which have different data based on dynamic configuration (like using a URL parameter) will have separate caches for each value used. How to use ConfigMask Here's a example of the constructor of our SharePoint 2019 DataSource, which expects lots of settings: public SharePoint2019() { // Specify what out-streams this data-source provides. Usually just one: \"Default\" Provide(GetList); // Register the configurations as tokens; values will be injected later on ConfigMask(ListNameConfigKey, $\"[Settings:ListName]\"); ConfigMask(SiteUrlConfigKey, $\"[Settings:SiteUrl]\"); ConfigMask(UserNameConfigKey, $\"[Settings:UserName]\"); ConfigMask(PasswordConfigKey, $\"[Settings:Password]\", false); ConfigMask(FieldsConfigKey, $\"[Settings:Fields]\"); ConfigMask(TitleFieldConfigKey, $\"[Settings:TitleField||Title]\"); ConfigMask(ViewConfigKey, $\"[Settings:View]\"); ConfigMask(MaxItemsConfigKey, $\"[Settings:MaxItems]\"); } This example adds 8 configuration masks - let's find out what exactly happens. Most of them just add a simple [Settings:SOMEKEY] so they will just take the value which the developer will configure in the UI The password has a special parameter false to ensure that it won't be used in the cache key (which would show it in certain debug scenarios) The title field has a fallback - so if it's not supplied, it will use Title by default Read also Configuration using Tokens DataSource Configuration Ensuring configuration is parsed Demo App and further links #todoc History Introduced in 2sxc 9.13 to aid custom data sources"

This is done with Configuration.Parse(). It will cycle through all settings previously added by ConfigMask and resolve the tokens. How to use Configuration.Parse() Here's a simple example of the PublishingFilter DataSources: public PublishingFilter() { Provide(PublishingFilterList); ConfigMask(QueryConstants.ParamsShowDraftKey, \"[MyConfiguration:ShowDrafts||false]\"); } const string ParamsShowDraftKey = \"ShowDrafts\"; public bool ShowDrafts { get => bool.Parse(Configuration[ParamsShowDraftKey]); set => Configuration[ParamsShowDraftKey] = value.ToString(); } private IImmutableList<IEntity> PublishingFilterList() { var before = ShowDrafts; // here it's \"[MyConfiguration:ShowDrafts||false]\" which would fail Configuration.Parse(); var after = ShowDrafts; // here it's `false` (or `true` if user is editor) var outStreamName = ShowDrafts ?

Important Before v15, the DataBuilder was used in custom DataSources to create entities. In v15+ you should use the IDataFactory instead. The following docs are out of date and will be upgraded soon. DataSource API: DataBuilder.Entity(...) Many data sources generate new content items - either because they deliver some kind of information, or because they convert data from another source into standardized entities. This is where DataBuilder.Entity(...) helps. Just fyi: Here are the API docs. There is also an Entities for multiple Entities. How the DataBuilder is added The DataBuilder is a IDataBuilder which is automatically given as a property DataBuilder. The DataSource-Factory creates it. How to use DataBuilder.Entity(...) Here's a simple example of the tutorial DateTime DataSource: const string DateFieldName = \"Date\"; var date = DateTime.Now; var values = new Dictionary<string, object> { {DateFieldName, date}, {\"Weekday\", date.DayOfWeek}, {\"DayOfWeek\", (int) date.DayOfWeek} }; // Construct the IEntity and return as ImmutableArray var entity = DataBuilder.Entity(values, titleField: DateFieldName); return new [] {entity}.ToImmutableArray(); This example shows how an entity-object is build using DataBuilder.Entity(values) on the ToSic.Eav.Data namespace. Concept Behind DataBuilder.Entity(...) Internally it will generate a simplified IEntity object. It's also missing some advanced features like multi-language and repository identity (which would be important in edit-scenarios). The simplest way is to just use DataBuilder.Entity(someDictionary), more advanced uses also tell the system which field is the title, some numeric or Guid IDs and more. Building Lists of Entities You can loop through your data and call DataBuilder.Entity(someDictionary) many times. You can also use the overload DataBuilder.Entities(IEnumerable<someDictionary>). Best read the API docs. More Parameters on DataBuilder.Entity(...) All paramaters are optional, except the first one containing the values. Here's what each one does: string titleField is the title field name, so the entity then also knows which one is the title and can support .EntityTitle property string typeName is a nice name for the type, allowing for type-filtering later in other data sources int id gives a number identity, so .EntityId is useful and filtering by EntityId (like when having details-pages needing this id) works Guid guidId is a UUID identity, so .EntityGuid is useful DateTime modified would allow to filter / sort by the .Modified property int appId could be used to pretend it's part of another app. This only affects the AppId property, and ATM there is no important reason to do this.

Providing multiple streams In case you want to offer multiple streams (like one containing products, the other categories), the common pattern is: public SomeConstructor() { ProvideOut(GetProducts); ProvideOut(GetCategories, \"Categories\"); // ... } Providing Data with Relationships In some cases you want the created Entities to have relationships to each other. Examples could be: Blog posts with relationships to their tags Tree structures such as folders etc. For this you should first understand how relationships are created. Every created entity is immutable. This means that it can't be modified once created. Now this poses a special challenge, because some of the referenced entities may not exist when the referencing entity (aka the parent) is created. So internally there is a lookup concept, which basically works like this: A Relationship Manager knows about all the entities and how they can be referenced An entity which needs other entities will get this manager injected A field which references other entities keeps a list of references - either the IDs or special strings like file-of:/some/path When the field is accessed, internally it will ask the ReferenceManager to find the entities For creating relationships you must do two things: Ensure that each new entity provides the keys it should be found on. If you are only using IDs, you don't have to do anything, but if you need magic strings, you must provide them. Tell the relationship fields (eg: MyChildren or Parent) what IDs / keys to use. Here's a simple example from the tutorial: using System.Collections.Generic; public class TreeBasic : Custom.DataSource.DataSource16 { public TreeBasic(MyServices services) : base(services, \"My.Magic\") { ProvideOut(() => { return new List<object> { // Root has ID 1 and points to 2 children CreateNode(1, \"Root Node\", new [] { 101, 102 }), // This is a subnode, with 2 more children CreateNode(101, \"Sub Item 101\", new [] { 1011, 1012 }), CreateNode(102, \"Sub Item 102\"), CreateNode(1011, \"Sub Item 1011\"), CreateNode(1012, \"Sub Item 1012\"), }; }); } private object CreateNode(int id, string title, int[] relationships = null) { return new { Id = id, Title = title, // To reference another item in the same list, // create an anonymous object with \"Relationships\" as an Enumerable, Array or List SubItems = new { Relationships = relationships } }; } } This example skips step one, because it only uses IDs. As you can see, the property SubItems creates a special object which contains the references to the children of a parent. 💡 For more examples, check out the Relationships Tutorial Performance Notes It's important to know that ProvideOut simply prepares the Out for use, but will not call the inner function unless this stream is requested.

This is because an In is often used to provide the DataSource with configuration information. In addition to that, many DataSources expect Data which will be processed.

Important Here we only explain aspects which are relevant to your code. Make sure you are familiar with the general concept of In-Streams.

But there are two important things you can change You can determine one or more predefined Out streams You can tell the UI that your Stream can have many, dynamically named Out-Streams just like the App DataSource Important Here we only explain aspects which are relevant to your code. Make sure you are familiar with the general concept of Out-Streams. Pre-Named Out-Streams For an example, we'll use the Paging DataSource. It's job is to take a list of items and only forward a chunk on the Default, like \"Page 3 containing items 61-90\". In addition it should also provide information as to what page we're on and how many pages exist. This is defined in the constructor, where the DataSource determines what it Provides #todoc. public Paging() { ProvideOut(GetList); ProvideOut(GetPaging, \"Paging\"); } The two lines of ProvideOut are the important bits: ProvideOut(GetList) will provide data on the Default Out-Stream ProvideOut(GetPaging, \"Paging\") will provide data on the Paging Out-Stream Dynamic Out Streams Some DataSources like the App DataSource can have many Out-streams which are not known till Runtime. To allow the UI to provide these, we must specify this in the VisualQuery attribute. Here's an example of the App DataSource: [VisualQuery( NameId = \"...\", Type = DataSourceType.Source, Icon = \"app\", DynamicOut = true, NiceName = \"App\", UiHint = \"...\", ConfigurationType = \"...\", HelpLink = \"...\")] The important part here is the DynamicOut = true. Strategies for Providing Dynamic Out Providing dynamic-out in your code can be tricky, and there are 2 strategies you can use: Create all Out-Streams on first Use of Out This would create the Out-Accessors when Out is first accessed. You can see examples of this on the App DataSource Re-Implement the Out of the type IDictionary<string, IDataStream> to do some kind of Lazy-Loading There is no example to do this, but it could be done. Note that this is fairly sophisticated so do spend some time to familiarize yourself with the EAV code before you attempt this.

To help the VisualQuery Designer give queues to the developer what can / can't be done, there is a VisualQuery decorator attribute which gives the class some more information.

If true the UI will indicate this with a yellot Out-marker. In Array of In-Streams which the UI will show as prepared landing markers to connect streams to. Name and Identity NameId - the Unique Identity The global name should be super-unique because it will be stored as the ID in Queries. We recommend you get a new random Guid here. NiceName This will be shown in the VisualQuery UI. Make sure it's reasonable. NameIds This is a for historical reasons. In rare cases we had to rename a DataSource and the old GlobalName values are listed here. Avoid using this. UI Enhancements Icon An icon name from the Material Icons. Type A value which tells the VisualQuery in what group to place this source for the Query developer. Must be a valid value from DataSourceType. HelpLink A url to a website containing help to this DataSource. UiHint Additional text to be shown in the UI. Configuration ConfigurationType This is the GUID (aka StaticName) of the Content-Type which should be used for configuring the DataSource. The UI will open a edit dialog for this Content-Type when the Query creator hits Settings on this DataSource.

    "keywords": "Data Sources (IDataSource) you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .datasource, .context-box-summary .query-datasource { visibility: visible; } Root DataSources are IDataSource objects which deliver one or many DataStreams, which contain a bunch of content-items. Two Core Types 1. Root DataSources This kind of DataSource generates or retrieves data from somewhere external like SQL, CSV, REST or the EAV-cache. This is a Root IDataSource. An example is the Csv DataSource. Note that even this DataSource can have use Data on the In-Stream. But in this case the In provides configuration data, not raw data to process. 2. Processing DataSources Processing DataSources receive data from another DataSource, then process/filter this and provide the result for further use, in which case it's both an IDataSource as well as an IDataTarget An example of this is the Shuffle DataSource. It receives items on the In[\"Default\"], randomly reorganizes them and provides them on the Out[\"Default]. DataSource Out can be another DataSources In Datasources can be chained so that processing steps happen in a sequence. Here's a very simple example: The root DataSource would be the App.Data which has all the data in the App It can then be connected to a EntityTypeFilter DataSource which will limit the data to all BlogPost items We can then connect it to a Shuffle DataSource to keep 3 random posts This can be done both in code as well as in a prepared VisualQuery. Queries: Reusable DataSource Wirings As described above, DataSources can be joined together and the configuration can be saved as a Query. Here's another example: a Root Csv DataSource can read a CSV-file and provide the data as a stream on Entities on csvDs[\"Default\"]... ...and pipe the result it to a CacheAllStreams which caches the data for 60 minutes this would ensure that the slow reading process only happens every hour ...then pipe it to a ValueFilter, which only shows the items where the Country matches the Url-parameters country ...then pipe it to a ValueSort, ordering it by LastName and then FirstName ...then pipe it to another CacheAllStreams so that this common filter/sort combination will be kept for 5 minutes The result can be used in a Template or streamed as JSON to a JavaScript SPA using the Headless API. Understanding Data-Flow between DataSource Objects Each DataSource has a list of out-streams available on the .Out[\"StreamName\"] property, but usually access directly just with the DataSourceName[\"StreamName\"]. This is what also happens when you use the Data object and write foreach(var item in Data[\"Default\"]). Aside from consuming data in your your template, most data-sources will simply offer the Out-Stream to other DataSources for further processing. Technically it's mapped like this: Cache.Out[\"Default\"] > ContentTypeFilter.In[\"Default\"] ... then some magic happens inside the ContentTypeFilter ... then the ContentTypeFilter.Out[\"Default\"] has the resulting items, which can again be used as an In on another DataSource, or simply used in your template Most DataSources will only have one In-stream and one Out-stream, but this is very variable depending on your need.

    "keywords": "Data Streams (IDataStream) you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .datasource { visibility: visible; } DataStreams are objects which behave like a table or a list. They deliver a bunch of content-items/Entities. Common examples in Razor-templates are: Data[\"Default\"] This is a data-stream containing all content-items prepared for the template. App.Data[\"Tag\"] This would be a data-stream containing all tag-items in the entire app, if the App has Tag items. Tip All DataSources have at least one Out-stream called Default. But they can have more streams as well. Most DataSources also have one or more In streams providing data or configuration to that DataSource which will then give a modified list to the Out. How to use The most commen uses will loop through all items in such a stream and show them. Here's an example: <ol> @foreach(var person in Data[\"Default\"]){ <li>@AsDynamic(person).FullName</li> } </ol> The @foreach will go through all the items. Each item is of the type IEntity. To make it easier to template, we convert it to a Dynamic Entity using AsDynamic and then we can just show the name with .FullName. In most cases we will need the loop-item a lot, and would preferr to not write AsDynamic every time. Because of this, we usually write the AsList in the Loop, like this: <ol> @foreach(var person in AsList(Data[\"Default\"])) { <li>@person.FullName - born @person.Birthday and married to @person.SpouseName</li> } </ol> Discover More in the Razor Tutorials We have an rich series of Razor tutorials. You should really check them out 👍. Advanced Use Cases There are some advanced use-cases where you need to know more about the IDataStream object, mostly when using LINQ. This is fairly rare, and if you really need to know more, it's best to consult the EAV DataSource code. Just a few more details you might care about: The stream has a property Source which points to the owning DataSource. a stream might be attached to many targets for further processing or for templating, but the stream doesn't know about this you can always looup through items on the stream itself using LINQ, like var blues = Data[\"Default\"].Where(x => AsDynamic(x).Category == \"Blue\")) see also Use LINQ with Dynamic Data in Dynamic Code of course there's always quite a bit more to it, like auto-caching, but you usually don't need to understand all that.

There are two ways to do this Set Configuration values on the DataSource objects Put Tokens in the Configuration Values of the objects Tip DataSource Objects are Single-Use, so any configuration you set must happen before data is accessed. Once Data has been retrieved (by accessing the List of a DataSource) the inner engine will cache the result and not re-run the code, so changing parameters afterwards will have no effect. Tip These samples require 2sxc 16. For older versions, check the code at the end of this page. Set Property Values Each DataSource object has unique properties you can set. Example: using ToSic.Eav.DataSources; // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = Kit.Data.GetSource<EntityTypeFilter>( attach: App.Data, // Use the apps data as input parameters: new { TypeName = \"Author\" } // tell it to filter by \"Author\" ); // access the data and automatically apply the filter/config var authors = allAuthors.List; This demonstrates the EntityTypeFilter DataSource. We attach it to the App.Data so that will be the input, before the filter is applied. It has a single configuration TypeName. Since we set the TypeName property to Author, only items of type Author will be returned. The Csv DataSource on the other hand has 5 Properties you can set like the file name to use, the delimiter etc. Tip Setting properties is the most common way to configure DataSources in C#. Set Property Tokens Tokens are usually used in VisualQuery but mentioned here for completeness. This is what you could do: using ToSic.Eav.DataSources; // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = Kit.Data.GetSource<EntityTypeFilter>( attach: App.Data, parameters: new { TypeName = \"[QueryString:TypeName]\" } ); CreateSource<EntityTypeFilter>(); // access the data and automatically apply the filter/config var authors = allAuthors.List; In this case we specified a Token which will be processed by the system and replaced before the DataSource does it's internal work. Tokens use a LookUp System to identify a source (in this case QueryString) and then ask that source for the value (in this case the url parameter TypeName). Tokens have additional features like fallbacks (so [QueryString:Typename||BlogPost] would use BlogPost if the URL didn't have a parameter). Since you will usually prefer to do this kind of value-resolution in your C# code, tokens are rarely used here. Deprecated Samples The following code is old/deprecated and shouldn't be used any more. But since many older samples used this (pre v15) we're still including it in the docs. // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = CreateSource<ToSic.Eav.DataSources.EntityTypeFilter>(); allAuthors.TypeName = \"Authors\"; // access the data and automatically apply the filter/config var authors = allAuthors[\"Default\"]; History Introduced in 2sxc 04.00 Massively enhanced in 2sxc 16 using Kit.Data which supports attach: and parameters: parameters"

Either because something prepared the DataSources for your code, or because your code explicitly requested a DataSource from the API. Some DataSources are prepared and always available in Razor and WebApi, like Data, App.Data or App.Query[\"QueryName\"] And you can also get other DataSources in C# code, like Kit.Data.GetSource<EntityTypeFilter>() Step 1: Use a DataSource This is a basic example of an Employees Razor Template. It uses the Data DataSource which is always available in Razor and WebApi. For some magical reasons we'll explain later, the Data is a DataSource which in this case provides all the Employees which should be shown. @foreach(var person in AsList(Data)) { <li>@person.FullName (@person.Function)</li> } This demonstrates Some magic in the background prepared Data to contain what should be shown A simple foreach can be used to loop through the data The Data returns IEntity objects but we need dynamic objects so we can do things like @person.FullName, so we use AsList which wraps the items inside Data Now we can just output the values as needed, like @person.FullName Discover More in the Razor Tutorials We have an rich series of Razor tutorials. You should really check them out 👍. Step 2: Understanding Prepared Data You will usually use DataSource objects in these common cases in both Razor and Custom WebApi: The Data object is a DataSource. It always has a Default stream (Data[\"Default\"]). Sotemites it has other streams like Data[\"ListContent\"] or Data[\"Categories\"] etc. The App.Data is a DataSource providing a stream for each content-type in this app, like App.Data[\"BlogPost\"] or App.Data[\"Tag\"] Every App.Query[...] is a DataSource. In the query you define which DataStreams it has. Eg. App.Query[\"SortedTags\"] would be a DataSource and typically the Default stream would contain all these tags. A query is actually a set DataSources doing one operation and passing it on to the next DataSource Step 3: Use The Data As Prepared In your code you'll usually work with these three sources which have been prepared for you: Data App.Data App.Query[...] If all you want is to loop through various lists already available, you'll usually work with AsList like this: @foreach(var item in AsList(Data)) { <li>@item.Title</li> } Note that AsList(Data) is a Shorthand for AsList(Data.List) or AsList(Data[\"Default\"].List): @foreach(var item in AsList(Data[\"Default\"].List)) { <li>@item.Title</li> } If your data-source Data, App.Data or App.Query[\"QueryName\"] has more than one stream, you would do this: @foreach(var item in AsList(App.Data[\"Categories\"])) { <li>@item.CategoryName</li> } Step 4: Create DataSource Objects in C#/Razor Code Sometimes you want to have full control over what a DataSource does or what parameters it's using. This is easy: // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = Kit.Data.GetSource<ToSic.Eav.DataSources.EntityTypeFilter>( attach: App.Data, // Use the apps data as input parameters: new { TypeName = \"Author\" } // tell it to filter by \"Author\" ); // access the data and automatically apply the filter/config var authors = allAuthors.List; 👉 Also read Set Parameters for DataSource Objects in C#/Razor Code Tip 2sxc 16 uses a new Kit.Data.GetSource(...) to get DataSources. Older code used CreateSource(...) which is still available, but deprecated. The new method is more powerful and we'll slowly migrate to that API only Step 5: Create a Query in Code by Attaching Data sources What the VisualQuery designer does is configure how DataSources are attached, mapping their in/out streams and adding parameters. You can also do this in code, but it's fairly advanced. You would usually want to do this, if you want to use a filter or something, but need to provide parameters which aren't available in the VisualQuery Designer. Here's a simple example: using ToSic.Eav.DataSources; // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = Kit.Data.GetSource<EntityTypeFilter>( attach: App.Data, // Use the apps data as input parameters: new { TypeName = \"Author\" } // tell it to filter by \"Author\" ); // Sort by FullName var sortedAuthors = Kit.Data.GetSource<ValueSort>(attach: allAuthors, parameters: { Attributes = \"FullName\" }); // Sort by FullName descending var sortedAuthorsDesc = Kit.Data.GetSource<ValueSort>(attach: allAuthors, parameters: { Attributes = \"FullName\", Directions = \"desc\" }); // Sort by 2 fields var sortedAuthorsMult = Kit.Data.GetSource<ValueSort>(attach: allAuthors, parameters: { Attributes = \"Website,FullName\", Directions = \"asc, desc\" }); // sort by internal EntityId var sortedAuthorsById = Kit.Data.GetSource<ValueSort>(attach: allAuthors, parameters: { Attributes = \"EntityId\" }); The most important thing to notice is that each additional data-source uses the first allAuthors DataSource as the default upstream DataSource. So when these sort/filter or do something, they will only receive the data already filtered by the allAuthors.

This is usually done by attaching it to another DataSource. Here is a simple example: using ToSic.Eav.DataSources; // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = Kit.Data.GetSource<EntityTypeFilter>( attach: App.Data, // Use the apps data as input parameters: new { TypeName = \"Author\" } // tell it to filter by \"Author\" ); Note the attach: App.Data. This says \"attach App.Data as the input to this DataSource on the stream Default\". Tip This is the most common way to attach a DataSource to another DataSource. How Attaching Works Internally links are created using the IDataSourceLink. The code above simply works, because every DataSource and every DataStream is also a IDataSourceLinkable. This means it has a .Link property which contains the DataSourceLink. When using the simple linking as specified above, the thing (in this case App.Data) will simply provide it's Default Out-stream as the Default In-stream to the target. Attaching to/from Another Name Sometimes you may want to attach to a different stream. There are two Scenarios Link data from a different Out-Stream (not Default) Link the data to a different In-Stream (not Default) Linking to a different Out-Stream This is done by linking from the desired out-stream. So instead of doing attach: App.Data you would do attach: App.Data[\"MyStream\"]. Linking to a different In-Stream This is done by renaming the target stream on the link, like this: attach: App.Data.Link.Rename(inName: \"Fallback\") The example above would attach the data not to the Default but to the stream Fallback. The Link property has all the commands needed for renaming etc., which is why you need to add .Link before calling Rename(...). Tip The IDataSourceLink API is fluent, functional and immutable. As such anything you write will only affect this use, and not really rename anything. Attaching Multiple DataSources Since any .Link provide a link, you can chain multiple links together like this: // First get the root data source - the App with all data var appDs2 = Kit.Data.GetAppSource(); // Now create a Type-Filter and tell it to only keep Books / Authors var books2 = Kit.Data.GetSource<EntityTypeFilter>(attach: appDs2, parameters: new { TypeName = \"Books\" }); var authors2 = Kit.Data.GetSource<EntityTypeFilter>(attach: appDs2, parameters: new { TypeName = \"Persons\" }); // The following lines are just spread for easier documentation // Usually you would write in inline var dataSourceLinks2 = books2.Link // Get the link to the books .Add(authors2.Link // Add the author2 link .Rename(inName: \"Stream2\" // but rename the link so it's attached as \"Stream2\" ) ); var merged2 = Kit.Data.GetSource<StreamMerge>(attach: dataSourceLinks2); History Introduced in 2sxc 16.00"

You should really check them out 👍. Using Statements As explained in the guide we recommend the following using statements in Razor: @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; Where Filter a list (IEnumerable) based on a criteria. Example: Basic filter of a list by string var items = AsList(Data[\"Default\"]); items = items.Where(p => p.Name == \"Chuck Norris\"); // items now contains only items which have \"Chuck Norris\" as name property Any Returns true if any of the elements matches a criteria. var items = AsList(Data[\"Default\"]); var containsChuckNorris = items.Any(p => p.Name == \"Chuck Norris\"); // if containsChuckNorris is true, at least one element has name \"Chuck Norris\" Here's another Any - to see if a relationship contains something. It's a bit more complex, because Razor needs to know what it's working with: // filter - keep only those that have this Category // note that the compare must run on the EntityId because of object wrapping/unwrapping postsToShow = postsToShow .Where(p => (p.Categories as List<dynamic>) .Any(c => c.EntityId == ListContent.Category[0].EntityId)) OrderBy / OrderByDescending Order a list (IEnumerable) by a specific field. var items = AsList(Data[\"Default\"]); items = items.OrderBy(p => p.Name); // items are now ordered by property \"Name\" First / Last Get first or last element of the list. var items = AsList(Data[\"Default\"]); var first = items.First(); // contains the first element var last = items.Last(); // contains the last element Select Transform list into a new list, selecting only specified field(s). var items = AsList(Data[\"Default\"]); var names = items.Select(p => p.Name); // names is a list of all names Take / Skip Paging functions: Take only n elements, skip m elements var items = AsList(Data[\"Default\"]); items = items.Skip(10).Take(10); // Skips the first 10 elements and select only 10 Count Count number of elements in a list. var items = AsList(Data[\"Default\"]); var count = items.Count(); // contains the number of elements in the list IndexOf Find index of a specific element in the list. @{ var items = AsList(Data[\"Default\"]); } @foreach(var item in items) { <h1>Item number @items.IndexOf(item)</h1> }"

We also recommend to play around with the Razor Tutorial App Discover More in the Razor Tutorials We have an rich series of Razor tutorials. You should really check them out 👍. LINQ Basics The way LINQ works is that the namespace System.Linq contains a bunch of extension methods like .Count(), .Where(...) and more. So to use LINQ you need to add a @using statement to razor or just using in a WebApi class. Here's a simple razor example: @using System.Linq; @{ var newestPosts = AsList(App.Data[\"BlogPost\"]) .OrderByDescending(b => b.PublicationDate) .Take(3); } This demonstrates: adding the using statement getting all the BlogPost items using App.Data[\"BlogPost\"] converting it to a list of dynamic objects which will allow the nice syntax using AsList(...) sorting these with newest on top using .OrderByDescending(...) on the property PublicationDate keeping only the first 3 using .Take(3) it also shows how placing the parts on separate lines makes the code easier to read Important: Working with LINQ and dynamic objects LINQ needs IEnumerable<...> Before we continue, it's important that you really understand that LINQ commands are stored as extension methods of IEnumerable<T>. So this works: @using System.Linq; @{ var list = new List<string> { \"word\", \"word\" }; var x = list.First(); } ...whereas this does not: @using System.Linq; @{ var y = 27.First(); } This sounds obvious, but there's an important catch: if the compiler doesn't know that something is an IEnumerable, it will not even try to use the LINQ extension methods, because it doesn't know that it can. So let's look at that... LINQs Problems with dynamic objects #1 Here's an example that would fail: @using System.Linq; @{ dynamic list = new List<string> { \"word\", \"word\" }; var x = list.First(); } The only difference to before is that list ist now dynamic. It contains the same object, but the compiler doesn't treat it that way. In Razor, we use dynamic objects all the time, where we run into this problem. Here's an example which fails: @using System.Linq; @{ var books = AsList(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithoutAuthors = books .Where(b => !b.Authors.Any()); } Internally the b.Authors returns a list of authors, but the compiler doesn't know this, since it's treated as a dynamic object. You would get an error. To solve this, we must tell the compiler that b.Authors is an IEnumerable, like this: @using System.Linq; @using System.Collections.Generic; @{ var books = AsList(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithoutAuthors = books .Where(b => !(b.Authors as IEnumerable<dynamic>).Any()); } But let's be honest - it's ugly, long and prone to typos. Especially in a complex query where you could have many of these. So we recommend to define a shorthand for it, like this: @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; @{ var books = AsList(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithoutAuthors = books .Where(b => !(b.Authors as Dynlist).Any()); } LINQs problem with dynamic objects #2 LINQ methods often have multiple signatures. This means the same command can be written in different ways and with different parameters. To detect the right method, the compiler needs to know the data-types used in the parameters. This causes problem with dynamic objects because the compiler doesn't know what it is until runtime. Check this out: @using System.Linq; @{ var dogString = \"dog\" dynamic dogDyn = \"dog\"; var list = new List<string> { \"dog\", \"cat\", \"hound\" }; var x = list.Contains(dogString); // this works var x = list.Contains(dogDyn); // this fails } To fix this, we must tell the compiler it's an object: @using System.Linq; @{ dynamic dynDog = \"dog\"; var list = new List<string> { \"dog\", \"cat\", \"hound\" }; var x = list.Contains(dynDog as object); } The above example is a bit trivial but here's a real life example, taken from the 2sxc razor tutorial: @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; @{ var persons = AsList(App.Data[\"Persons\"]); var books = AsList(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithAwardedAuthors = books .Where(b => (b.Authors as Dynlist) .SelectMany(a => a.Awards as Dynlist) .Any() ); var otherBooks = books .Where(b => !(booksWithAwardedAuthors as Dynlist) .Contains(b as object) ); } LINQs problem with dynamic object #3 The last bit has to do with how dynamic objects are built, since they are usually wrapper-objects to help write nicer template code. As wrappers, they are different objects every time. This shows the problem: @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; @{ // this is just the data object, \"@bookData.Author\" wouldn't work var bookData1 = App.Data[\"Books\"].First(); var bookData2 = App.Data[\"Books\"].First(); // this is now a dynamic object, allowing @bookDyn1.Author\" var bookDyn1 = AsList(bookData1); var bookDyn2 = AsList(bookData2); var dataIsSame = bookData1 == bookData2; // true var dynIsSame = bookDyn1 == bookDyn2; // false before 2sxc 9.42 } This doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is. Look at this code from the example above: var otherBooks = books .Where(b => !(booksWithAwardedAuthors as Dynlist) .Contains(b as object) ); The .Contains(...) clause receives a variable b which is actually the dynamic wrapper, and will not be the same as the dynamic wrapper of dynamic wrappers given in booksWithAwardedAuthors. So contains would always say \"nope, didn't find it\". Solving the comparison / equality problem requires the underlying wrapper object to tell the .net framework, that ==, != and a few internal methods must work differently. 2sxc 9.42 does this, so the above code would actually work in 2sxc 9.42, but not in previous versions. If another system gives you dynamic objects, you will probably have to write it like this: // this example is for non-2sxc objects or 2sxc before 9.42 var otherBooks = books .Where(b => !(booksWithAwardedAuthors as Dynlist) .Contains(bookWithAward => bookWithAward != null && bookWithAward.SomeProperty == b.SomeProperty) ); LINQs problem with boolean null-objects In many cases, dynamic objects could have a property like Show which could be a boolean, but it could also be null. So this could cause an error: var show = links.Where(x => x.Show); To fix this, the easiest way is to really compare it with true or false as you want, each way will result in treating the null as the opposite (so you decide if null should be yes or no): @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; Dynlist list; list = links.Where(x => x.Show == true); // take true, skip false & null list = links.Where(x => x.Show != true); // take false & null, skip true list = links.Where(x => x.Show == false); // take false, skip true & null list = links.Where(x => x.Show != false); // take true & null, skip false list = links.Where(x => x.Show == null); // take null, skip true & false Read also, Demo App and further links LINQ API Docs Razor Tutorial App showing all kinds of Queries History Guide created 2019-03"

    "keywords": "you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .data-all, .context-box-summary .prepare-all { visibility: visible; } Mocking Typed Data In some scenarios you have code which expects to work with existing data, but in certain cases the data may not be available. Example Scenario Imagine you have a Razor which shows details about a building, but in some cases the build data is not available. In this case you want to show a fallback, like a default building. For this, the pseudo-code would look like this: @{ var building = expectedBuilding; } <h1>@building.Title</h1> <table> <!-- show specs --> <table> How to Show Mock Data instead Option 1: Lots of if-statements You could use a bunch of if-statements everywhere, but this is not elegant. That would look a bit like this: @{ var building = expectedBuilding; var mockTitle = \"Default Building\"; } <h1> @if (expectedBuilding != null) { @expectedBuilding.Title } else { @mockTitle } </h1> Option 2: Use a special Dummy-Entity (record) You could have a special entity containing the demo data, and use that. This is the approach which is provided by default in views which should show dummy-data until the editor adds custom information. In the default-views-setup this just magically works, because the view-configuration knows what item to provide when there is no user-data yet. But for more advanced scenarios, you would need to do this manually. It would look a bit like this: @{ var building = expectedBuilding ?? AsItems(App.Data[\"Buildings\"]).FirstOrDefault(b => b.SpecialId == \"Dummy\"); } <h1>@expectedBuilding.Title</h1> This is a reasonable approach and should be used where it makes sense. But there are issues with this: It requires a clear way to find the dummy-item in the list of all items, and this marker should never change The list of all data always contains some dummy data, which must be filtered out in other scenarios Option 3: Use Mock Data A very popular way to handle this is using mock data. Here's an example: @{ var building = expectedBuilding ?? AsItem(new { Title = \"Default Building\", Description = \"This is a default building\", Image = \"file:72\", }, mock: true); } <h1>@expectedBuilding.Title</h1> Note the mock: true in the AsItem(new {...}, mock: true). Without this parameter, 2sxc would throw an error. The reason is that 2sxc wants to make sure that you are aware that you are using mock data. So without the mock: true, 2sxc will only accept Entity-like objects in AsItem(). With the mock: true it will also accept any other object, and will then create a mock-entity from it. Basic Mock Data The mock data API is quite powerful, so let's see some advanced examples: var m = AsItem(new { Id = 99999, // The Id will be available on m.Id Guid = Guid.NewGuid(), // The Guid will be available on m.Guid Title = \"Dummy Item\", // The Title will be available on m.Title SomeNumber = 42, // eg. for m.Int(\"SomeNumber\") or m.Float(\"SomeNumber\") SomeString = \"Hello\", // eg. for m.String(\"SomeString\") }, mock: true); Mock Data with Sub-Objects Items can have sub-objects such as Children or the special Presentation object. Here are some examples: var m = AsItem(new { Presentation = new { // m.Presentation Highlight = true, // m.Presentation.Bool(\"Highlight\") GalleryMode = \"tiles\", // m.Presentation.String(\"GalleryMode\") }, Architect = new { // m.Child(\"Architect\") Title = \"John Doe\", // m.Child(\"Architect\").Title Website = \"https://www.2sxc.org\", // m.Child(\"Architect\").String(\"Website\") }, tags = new object[] { // foreach(var t in m.Children(\"tags\") new { Title = \"Tag 1\", }, new { Title = \"Tag 2\", }, } }, mock: true); Mock Parents Any normal TypedItem has a Method .Parents(...) to find other entities which are related. This is the opposite of .Children(...) which finds children. If your code expects parents, you can mock it like this: var m = AsItem(new { Parents = new object[] { // foreach(var p in m.Parents(\"tags\") new { Title = \"How to get your dream-home\", Type = \"Blog\", }, new { Title = \"Evaluating Architects\", Type = \"Blog\", }, new { Title = \"Modern Architecture\", Type = \"CaseStudy\", Field = \"Primary\", }, new { Title = \"Modern Architecture\", Type = \"CaseStudy\", Field = \"Example\", }, new { Title = \"Modern Architecture\", Type = \"CaseStudy\", Field = \"Example\", }, } }, mock: true); At first, this seems similar to the Children example, but there is more too it. The reason is that the .Parents(...) has optional parameters: type is used to only find parents, which have a specific type, such as only Blog parents field allows us to restrict the list even further, eg. only type CaseStudy which reference this in the Primary field var blogParents = m.Parents(type: \"Blog\"); var caseStudyParents = m.Parents(type: \"CaseStudy\"); var caseStudyPrimaryParents = m.Parents(type: \"CaseStudy\", field: \"Primary\"); Mock Links / References Links can be values such as https://... or internal references such as page:123 or file:50203. Note that the IDs in the examples below must of course exist on your system. var m = AsItem(new { // m.Url(\"Website\") and m.String(\"Website\") both return the same Website = \"https://www.2sxc.org\", // m.String(\"ListPage\") will contain `page:123` // m.Url(\"ListPage\") will contain the full url to the page ListPage = \"page:123\", // m.String(\"Logo\") will contain `file:50203` // m.Url(\"Logo\") will contain the full url to the file Logo = \"file:50203\", }, mock: true); Mock Files Typed Items can reference one or many files, using these APIs: thing.File(\"fieldName\") to get a single IFile thing.Folder(\"fieldName\") to get an IFolder containing zero or more files and folders var m = AsItem(new { // m.String(\"Logo\") will contain `file:50203` // m.Url(\"Logo\") will contain the full url to the file // m.File(\"Logo\") will contain the IFile object to this file Logo = \"file:50203\", }, mock: true); Tip As of now, mocking files is possible, but mocking folders is not supported.

    "keywords": "What is Dependency Injection? Dependency Injection is a way to structure applications and to get Services or Helpers in your code. Tip When an application becomes advanced it becomes more difficult to get Services and Helpers because these may also rely on other Services and Helpers to function. Dependency Injection makes sure that you don't need to know about the sub-dependencies, and just work with what you need. Most advanced solutions today use Dependency Injection or Inversion of Control (IoC) to handle this problem. The concept builds on two core parts: There is a shared Service Provider which can give me any Service I need Every piece of code uses this Service Provider to fetch everything it needs In .net Core and .net MVC this is a standard thing everybody learns early on (even though they probably don't understand it 😉). But in the .net Classic it was not so common, so older developers tend to not use it, so here some more details to round off the picture how this works in .net: .net provides an IServiceProvider which is this shared ServiceProvider. At application start-up all parts & services are registered and there are specifications if they should be shared (singleton), shared-per-http-request (scoped) or recreated for each use (transient). All parts & services in turn must also get their dependencies from this ServiceProvider. This happens in 2 ways Either they have a constructor which lists all their dependencies, like public MyClass(ICmsContext context) - in this case the ServiceProvider will automatically fetch the ICmsContext when the MyClass is created. Or they depend on the service provider to generate new objects later on, using public MyClass(IServiceProvider sp) and later running things like var context = sp.GetService<ICmsContext>(). This is common in scenarios where you may need multiple separate objects (like to generate a list of objects which again need dependencies). Or they request Lazy dependencies - which are heavier objects that are maybe not used, using public MyClass(Lazy<ICmsContext> contextLazy). These are not automatically created, but will be created if they are used. Or there is a Factory master-object which creates objects and adds their dependencies later on. This is how Razor in .net Core works. Using this setup anything can easily be requested when needed, and even if it needs dependencies which again have sub-dependencies, all this is automatically taken care of without the final code having to know about the structure. This also has 2 more important benefits: Internals can easily change, but the code using a service doesn't need to be updated It's easy to replace parts of the system without affecting the code itself. For example, 2sxc has different Url-Resolvers in Dnn and Oqtane, but your code doesn't need to know about this History of Dependency Injection in 2sxc 2sxc introduced Dependency Injection 1.1 in v9 (May 2017) Integrated with Oqtane DI in v12 (May 2021) GetService<T> pattern introduced for Razor/C# in v12 (May 2021) Integrated with Oqtane DI in v12 (May. 2021) Upgraded to Dependency Injection 2.1 in v13 (Dec. 2021) Integrated with Dnn DI in v13 (Dec. 2021) Created ServiceKits for v14 (June 2022)"

    "keywords": "Data / @Data in Dynamic Code What is Data A 2sxc instance is a running 2sxc-engine which is about to execute some code (Razor, Token or a web service) together with some content-items which should be used in this case. These content-items are provided to the code in an object called Data. 2sxc will decide what items to deliver, based on the situation. In most cases, a Dnn-Module will show a 2sxc-template, and the content-editor will manually add items to it using the normal web-UI. In this case, these items will be tied to this use-case and 2sxc will deliver them in the Data object. In other cases, the template (or view) will be configured to get data from a query configered elsewhere. In this case, all data retrieved in the query will be provided in the same Data object. There are also cases, where a template needs both queried data (like all categories) as well as content-items added manually. There are multiple easy ways of doing this todo - document later Note: if you want all data of a type, like \"Get me all Tag-items in the system\" you need to use App-Data. Discover More in the Razor Tutorials We have an rich series of Razor tutorials. You should really check them out 👍. Most common way to use the Data object In all Razor-templates and also the web-api files, the Data object is already created and ready to access. Here's a code example: <div class=\"app-blog\"> @foreach(var post in AsList(Data)) { // do something with the @post here } </div> the foreach will loop through all items of the data in the Stream Default - read more about streams below the var post is the inner variable containing the current item the AsDynamic will ensure that the items we're working with are easy to code with, because they are Dynamic Entities The Streams in a Data Object The data object can have multiple Streams, each containing a list of items. In most cases you'll just have the Default stream, which you can access using Data[\"Default\"]. Read more about streams in the Stream docs But you may also have additional streams, depending on what has been configured in the data-preparation stuff (usually a VisualQuery). For example, if you are working on a view showing one product and a menu with all possible categories, then your query may have these streams: Book (the current book, this stream has 1 item with the ID matching the ID in the URL) Categories (all categories in the system, sorted A-Z) The code would then look a bit like this: var book = Data[\"Book\"].FirstOrDefault(); // returns an IEntity Object var cats = Data[\"Categories\"]; // returns an IEnumerable of iEntity objects Or in most cases, because of the simpler syntax later on: var book = AsDynamic(Data[\"Book\"].FirstOrDefault()); // returns one dynamic entity var cats = AsList(Data[\"Categories\"]); // returns an IEnumerable of dynamic entities Changing what is provided by Data The main configuration of the template will determine, what data is initially provided to the template. Afterwards, other mechanisms can override / change this. Initial Sources Default type/list configuration - this can determine that 0, 1 or many items (of a certain type) are delivered if one or many are delivered, then the selection will be based on what the editor added to the module instance. VisualQuery - if the template has a query attached, this query will deliver the data Modifications to the source for the template The event CustomizeData can optionally completely reconfigure what Data contains in your code. Data Object API The Data object itself is actually a normal EAV IDataSource. So if you need to know more about the internals, read it up there. All other properties of the Data object are very special use only, so you probably shouldn't bother about them - which is why they are not documented here."

Here you can discover more about the optimizations. The loop iterates through all tags with the @foreach(var tag in AsList(App.Data[\"Tag\"])), creates <li> items and links these to a page defined in the App.Settings. How it works Whenever a 2sxc-instance is created to render a page or to deliver JSON data, the App object is created and prepared to deliver everything you need. It's very performant, because it doesn't actually get any data or run any queries unless these are accessed.

So a draft-item could have a live-item (but doesn't have to), and a live-item could have a draft item. This is important, because the admin/editor will see all the draft items, while the end-user will only see the live ones. So the exact items shown and the item-count can differ if you are logged in. App Settings and Resources In the App dialogs you can manage Settings and Resources. Basically both are a content-item with the fields you specify, the only difference is the purpose they have. You should put button-labels, standard-texts, decorative images etc. into Resources and these will often change from language to language. You should put settings like \"what page is xxx on\" or \"the primary color is #53aaff\" into Settings You would normally use it like this: <h1 class='@App.Settings.HeadingsDecorators'> @Content.Title </h1> <div> @Content.Body </div> <a href=\"@App.Settings.DisclaimerPage\"> @App.Resources.Disclaimer </a> As you can see, the HeadingsDecorators or DisclaimerPage are best placed in the Settings, while the label of the Disclaimer link are best handled as a multi-language Resource.

Tip 2sxc 13.10 adds a new ImageService which helps generate the best possible HTML for images. Only use the Link.Image(...) where really necessary, because the IImageService is usually the better choice. Simple Examples <!-- simple example --> <img src='@Link.Image(Content.MainPicture)'> <!-- simple example with resize --> <img src='@Link.Image(url: \"test.jpg\", width: 250, height: 700)'> <!-- simple example with resize and custom quality --> <img src='@Link.Image(url: \"test.jpg\", width: 250, height: 700, quality: 75.2)'> Using Preconfigured Image Sizes The Image method can also use predefined image configuration.

Parameters To promote long term API stability, we require most parameters to be named when used. This allows us to add further parameters later on, and the calls will still work. The first three parameters don't need naming, as they will be the most used. They are these in this order: url - the only required parameter settings - optional, would be an image-settings configuration factor - optional multiplier - eg. 0.5 to be half the size of the preset configuration All other parameters need to be named: width width in pixels height height in pixels quality a quality factor between 1 and 100; eg. jpgs usually have 50 - 80 resizeMode which can be max, crop, pad etc. scaleMode which can be up, down (default) or both format which can be jpg, png, gif aspectRatio So this will work: @Link.Image(\"test.jpg\", Settings.Images.Content, 0.5) @Link.Image(url: \"test.jpg\", settings: Settings.Images.Content, factor: 0.5) @Link.Image(\"test.jpg\", width: 200) ...and this won't: @Link.Image(\"test.jpg\", 200) Demo App and further links 🎓 Image Resizer Parameters with Link.Image 📔 Images Guide (Best Practices & Code) History Introduced in 2sxc 12.04 For many cases you should now use the ImageService in 2sxc 13.10+"

Method new v16.01 The Html method is a new feature in 2sxc 16.01 which allows you to render a property/field as HTML. The main purpose is to allow you to render a rich-text field as HTML, but it can also be used to render other fields. Simple example assuming a blog-post with a Body field: @post.Html(\"Body\") Behavior / Features of the Html Method Return an IHtmlTag object which can be rendered as HTML directly Wrap the value in a <div> tag by default (but you can change this) Sometimes automatically add an edit-toolbar for this specific field Automatically do some optimizations on certain field types, such as string-wysiwyg Default Behavior By default it will just do this Wrap in a <div> tag Output the value So by default it will not add a toolbar, and it will not do any special processing. Behavior on Rich, string-wysiwyg fields If the field is a string-wysiwyg field which has been configured to be of the new Rich type, it will automatically do the following: Wrap in a <div> tag Add some helper classes to the <div> tag to ensure proper styling Add a toolbar to edit the field Change all the images in the wysiwyg to be responsive, lazy-loaded and multiple resolutions Automatically process InnerContent just like the IRenderService Tip In future, other field types will also receive special treatment, so for now, you should only use this on fields where you expect the special treatment. Container By default, it will always add a div tag around the value. This is to ensure that the contents is properly styled and to allow adding a toolbar. To change this, you can specify the container parameter to be one of the following: null - default, the default div container will be added \"\" - empty string, no container will be added \"tagname\" - any tag name like p, span, h1 etc. will be added IHtmlTag - any IHtmlTag object will be added, usually created using Kit.HtmlTags.TagName() Examples: @* default, will wrap in a div *@ @post.Html(\"Body\") @post.Html(\"Body\", container: null) @* don't wrap in any container *@ @post.Html(\"Body\", container: \"\") @* will warp in a <p> or <h1> tag *@ @post.Html(\"Body\", container: \"p\") @post.Html(\"Body\", container: \"h1\") @* will warp in a <div class='my-class'> tag *@ @post.Html(\"Body\", container: Kit.HtmlTags.Div().Class(\"my-class\")) Toolbar By default, it will not add a toolbar, unless it's a string-wysiwyg field. To change this, you can specify the toolbar parameter to be one of the following: null - default, the default behavior will apply false - enforce no toolbar true - enforce a toolbar to edit just this field For any other custom behavior, use toolbar: false and add your own toolbar to the container. Examples: @* default, normal fields will not have a toolbar *@ @post.Html(\"Title\") @post.Html(\"Title\", toolbar: false) @* normal fields can enable the field-toolbar *@ @post.Html(\"Title\", toolbar: true) @* string-wysiwyg fields will have a toolbar *@ @post.Html(\"Body\") @post.Html(\"Body\", toolbar: true) @* string-wysiwyg fields can disable the toolbar *@ @post.Html(\"Body\", toolbar: false) Image Resize Settings If the field is a string-wysiwyg field which has been configured to be of the new Rich type, it will automatically replace all images with a responsive, lazy-loaded version. To do this, it uses the resize configuration called Wysiwyg. This is different from Content as it doesn't enforce a specific height. To change this, you can do various things: Reconfigure the Wysiwyg image settings on the App, Site or entire System Specify another word such as Content in the imageSettings parameter Specify another configuration object in the imageSettings parameter Debug Especially in the case of string-wysiwyg fields, it can be very helpful to see what's going on. To make this possible, there is a parameter debug which can be set to true. 👉🏽 Read more in the Rich WYSIWYG docs History Introduced in 2sxc 16.01 for the new Rich-Text field type"

Code example using a Dynamic Entity We'll assume we have a Content Type called Book with the following properties: Title (text, 1-line) Teaser (text, multi-line) Description (text, html) ReleaseDate (date) Author (entity - another content item) Here's a code example in a C# Razor template: <!-- The default variable for the current item is Content, we'll just use another name for this sample note that .Title is automatically provided, because the content-type has the property title. --> <h1>@Content.Title</h1> <div>@Content.Description</div> <div>Author: @Content.Author.FullName</div> So basically all properties of this book can be shown using [Object].[PropertyName] - for example Content.ReleaseDate. What Dynamic Entity really does - and how Technically the dynamic entity object is like a read-helper for the more complex IEntity. So actually the dynamic entity object will keep a reference to the underlying read-only IEntity item on a property Entity, and whenever your code accesses a property, the dynamic entity will query it from the underlying Entity. The main things that the dynamic entity does for you, are Give you a nice, short syntax to access a property - so Content.FirstName instead of Object.Attributes[\"FirstName\"][\"en\"] which would be necessary using the more advanced IEntity object Ensure that the language used in retrieving a value is the current user language Give conveniant access to related information like the Presentation object Automatically handle some data-not-found errors Automatically do conversions, like convert related entities (like .Children) into dynamic objects to make your code more consistant How the Property Lookup Works Internally there are a few things that can returned if you do something like Content.SomeProperty If the SomeProperty is one of the internal properties like EntityId etc. (see below) this will be returned Next is a simple property of the underlying Entity, like FirstName which would be a string or a relationship property like Tags which will return a special DynamicEntity that behaves as a list (see below) Last but not least - if nothing matches, it's null Properties of a Dynamic Entity Read the API docs in the IDynamicEntity. Additional properties that work (they are dynamic, so don't appear in the code) EntityId int EntityGuid Guid EntityType string - the type name like Person IsPublished bool - true/false if this item is currently published AnyProperty dynamic, but actually bool | string | decimal | datetime | List any normal property of the content-item can be accessd directly. It's correctly .net typed (string, etc.) Tip In 2sxc 10.27 any property that returns a List<DynamicEntity> now returns a IDynamicEntity containing a list. This means that if you expect the list to just return one item, you can directly access its properties like this: Content.Author.FirstName.

Here's an example: <ul> @foreach(var tag in blogPost.Tags) { <li>@tag.Name</li> } </ul> To get really good at coding lists, there are a few things you want to learn: Use list from different sources Entities which are a property of something (like blogPost.Tags) Entities which belong to the Module Entities which come from a Query Entities of a specific Content-Type from App.Data Difference between Entity-lists and DynamicEntity-Lists Looping Using LINQ to sort, filter and more Basics First - What Are Lists of Dynamic Entities In the lingo of C# they are IEnumerable<IDynamicEntity> objects. But basically lists are objects that can be stepped through (iterated). You will usually use them to show the list of items (like a list of News items). And if the list has too much data or is in a weird sorting order, you'll usually want to filter and sort before doing this. How to Get a List of Dynamic Entities In many cases the list is aleady there for you to use. For example, if your BlogPost object has a property Tags which is an Entity-Picker in the Edit-UI, then this will automatically work: <ul> @foreach(var tag in blogPost.Tags) { <li>@tag.Name</li> } </ul> In other scenarios you may get objects which are still IEntity objects. For example, App.Data[\"BlogPost\"] will get you a list of IEntity objects. But these don't allow you to just access a property, so you'll have to use AsList(...). @* this won't work *@ Find some information Whenever you create a content-type - like Person - and want to work with the data in your C# Razor templates, you'll be working with a Dynamic Entity. 👉 also read about AsDynamic(...)

For example you may need i18n Resources (like the label of a button). This could be in the View Resources or in the App Resources. It would be cumbersome to write code to check all this, which is there the DynamicStack comes in. The DynamicStack will hold a stack of Entities or DynamicEntities. It will ask them in sequence if they have the value you need, and return the first match. The order of the stack is important, as the first entity to provide an answer will be used. Dynamic Stacks behave as if they were Dynamic Entities. Examples of Dynamic Stacks In Razor and WebApi you will find these objects are Dynamic Stacks: Settings Resources Why Use Dynamic Stacks? Our core goal is the consolidation of spread out Settings and Resources. We're not yet sure if developers will find other uses for this, but we're pretty sure there are some cool reasons to do this. Some Ideas we have are: Make your code simpler by merging 2-3 objects which describe the same thing, like a Person and Profile Merge Presentation settings with Defaults from another Entity How to Create a Dynamic Stack In 2sxc 12.02 there is an experimental overload of AsDynamic(...) to create your own stacks. Here's how it works: // the personEntity and profileEntity are Entity objects var person = AsDynamic(personEntity); var name = person.Name; var profile = AsDynamic(profileEntity); var favoriteColor = profile.FavoriteColor; var stack = AsDynamic(personEntity, profileEntity); var nameFromStack = stack.Name; var colorFromStack = stack.FavoriteColor; Possible Gotchas with Dynamic Stacks Proritized by Source, not Language As of now, the stack always checks each entity one by one to see if it can supply an answer. This means that if one source has an answer from the fallback language it will supply it, even if a later source might have the perfect answer in the primary language. We're not sure how relevant this is, but it's something you will want to keep in mind. Empty Values are Treated as No Value To detect if a value should be used the code checks for emptyness. This means an empty string or an empty list of relationships will be treated as no-hit and the search will continue through the stack. This also means that it may be difficult to \"nullify\" a value in a higher-level source, as that will be ignored. Read Also 👉 API docs for IDynamicStack History Introduced in 2sxc 12.02"

Background: dynamic Objects In Razor, especially before 2sxc 16 which introduced the strictly typed mode, most object are dynamic. This means that the compiler doesn't know what's in them, and can't check if a method exists. Example using a Razor14 class or earlier: // Settings is a dynamic object in Razor14 or similar // This works, because the method \"Get(...)\" exists Settings.Get(\"SomeSetting\"); // This kind of call will fail at RUNTIME // Because the compiler can't check earlier if the method exists var willBreak = Settings.IsOk(); Note that this problem can also occur in more complex code, such as: // a is treated as dynamic // since part of the logic uses a dynamic object var a = SomeKindOfHelper.CheckIfNull(Settings) ? \"ok\" : \"not ok\"; // This will fail at runtime with the above message a.DoSomethingImpossible(); Possible Causes the object is null the object is not what you thought it is (eg. you expected a List<...> but got an IEntity) the method doesn't exist the method exists, but the signature is very different from what you tried to call Solution: Fix your Code In many cases the runtime will tell you what line the error was on, in which case you can see what method was trying to be called. In other cases you don't know the exact line of code. Our recommendation is: First Make sure you know what line breaks If the compiler told you, you're lucky. If not, you'll have to work it out. The easiest way to do this is to comment out most of the code until you don't have an error, and put the code back in piece by piece. Then Figure out the Cause The following example assumes that your object is called myThing and you're trying to call myThing.DoSomething(). 1. Check if the object is null <div> @* this will show true or false *@ Debug: @(myThing == null) </div> 2. Check what type the object is <div> @* this will show the type name *@ Debug: @myThing.GetType().Name </div> 3. Check if the method and signature exists You could do some reflection here, but once you know the type, I recommend you just check the docs.

It usually means that you have code using DynamicEntity which had to be moved to another namespace for consistency. We're sorry about the breaking change. From what we see it mainly affects the very old FAQ app which had some very old coding style in it for LINQ. In this case it was not possible to clean 2sxc and still ensure that this works, because of type-casting restrictions in C# related to covariance and contravariance. Background: DynamicEntity was moved To create the public documentation we had to make sure our API was consistent, and IEntity was one of the exceptions. Before 2sxc 10.20 it was in the namespace ToSic.SexyContent. We standardized it now to ToSic.Sxc.Data so the full name is ToSic.Sxc.Data.DynamicEntity. Quick Fix: Change the namespace Your code probably has a @using ToSic.SexyContent. You should change this to @using ToSic.Sxc.Data; And everything should work. But please also check the good fix below: Good Fix: Change to <dynamic> Razor code shouldn't actually need to know the type of this dynamic entity. So it's better to replace occurances of DynamicEntity with the appropriate dynamic. For example, replace List<DynamicEntity> with IEnumerable<dynamic> (note that List<dynamic> won't work because of covariance restrictions). In the example of the FAQ app, it's recommended you change line 23 <li class=\"sc-element faq-set\" data-tags=\"@String.Join(\",\", ((List<DynamicEntity>)q.Categories).Select(a => AsDynamic(a).EntityId))\"> to <li class=\"sc-element faq-set\" data-tags=\"@String.Join(\",\", (q.Categories as IEnumerable<dynamic>) .Select(a => AsDynamic(a).EntityId))\"> To better understand this, best consult the LINQ Tutorials Full Error Example A full error can look like this: Error: System.Web.HttpCompileException (0x80004005): ...\\Portals\\...\\2sxc\\FAQ with Categories\\_All questions (sorted) of a selected category.cshtml(23): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'DynamicEntity' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) at System.Web.Compilation.AssemblyBuilder.Compile() at System.Web.Compilation.BuildProvidersCompiler.PerformBuild() at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.CompileWebFile(VirtualPath virtualPath) at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.GetVPathBuildResultInternal(VirtualPath virtualPath, Boolean noBuild, Boolean allowCrossApp, Boolean allowBuildInPrecompile, Boolean throwIfNotFound, Boolean ensureIsUpToDate) at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.GetVPathBuildResultWithNoAssert(HttpContext context, VirtualPath virtualPath, Boolean noBuild, Boolean allowCrossApp, Boolean allowBuildInPrecompile, Boolean throwIfNotFound, Boolean ensureIsUpToDate) at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.GetVirtualPathObjectFactory(VirtualPath virtualPath, HttpContext context, Boolean allowCrossApp, Boolean throwIfNotFound) at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.GetCompiledType(VirtualPath virtualPath) at ToSic.Sxc.Engines.RazorEngine.CreateWebPageInstance() in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\2Sexy Content Razor\\Engines\\Razor\\RazorEngine.cs:line 107 at ToSic.Sxc.Engines.RazorEngine.InitWebpage() in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\2Sexy Content Razor\\Engines\\Razor\\RazorEngine.cs:line 128 at ToSic.Sxc.Engines.RazorEngine.Init() in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\2Sexy Content Razor\\Engines\\Razor\\RazorEngine.cs:line 43 at ToSic.Sxc.Engines.EngineBase.Init(ICmsBlock cmsBlock, Purpose purpose, ILog parentLog) in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\ToSic.Sxc\\Engines\\EngineBase.cs:line 76 at ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.CmsBlock.GetRenderingEngine(Purpose renderingPurpose) in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\ToSic.Sxc\\Blocks\\CmsBlock_Render.cs:line 122 at ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.CmsBlock.Render() in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\ToSic.Sxc\\Blocks\\CmsBlock_Render.cs:line 56 Here's a print-screen: Shortlink: https://go.2sxc.org/ErrDynamicEntity"

Background: Dynamic Code and Extension Methods Razor is dynamically compiled code, and many objects like Content are typed as dynamic. Because of this, the compiler can't be sure what's in a dynamic object, and also not what is in a Content.Tags - since this too is regarded as dynamic. This is why you can't just write Content.Tags.First(), because .First() is an extension method which the compiler must find first - but it can't do that, since it doesn't know that Content.Tags are of the type IEnumerable<...>. Solution #1 - use AsList(...) 2sxc 10.20 introduces AsList(...) which the compiler knows is an IEnumerable. Unfortunately if the the compiler isn't sure about Content.Tags, then it's also not sure about AsList(Content.Tags). This is a minor inconvenience, since AsList(...) would figure things out, but Razor wants to be sure. So to use AsList() for solving this problem, you'll need to write AsList(Content.Tags as object). That solves it. Solution #2 - cast as IEnumerable<dynamic> If you already know it's a list, you can also cast it as an IEnumerable<dynamic>. Since IEnumerable<T> is in the namespace System.Collections.Generic you have 3 options: Cast with full Namespace This is what the compiler actually understands - but it's a bit long and hard to read: var authors = (book.Authors as System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>) .Select(a => a.FirstName + \" \" + a.LastName); Cast with @using and IEnumerable<dynamic> This is the same thing, just nicer to read: @using System.Collections.Generic; var authors = (book.Authors as IEnumerable<dynamic>) .Select(a => a.FirstName + \" \" + a.LastName); Cast with @using Dynlist = ...

In certain cases it would be good if the razor-view could verify that the feature is enabled - for example to show a warning when it isn't enabled yet. This is what the Features API is for. How To Use This example is taken from Mobius Forms and the code can be found in the Mobius Github Repo. @{ var feats = GetService<ToSic.Sxc.Services.IFeaturesService>(); // show warning if the save-attachments in web api isn't activated if(!feats.IsEnabled(\"SaveInAdamApi\")) { <div class=\"alert alert-warning\"> Warning: file upload won't work yet, as it hasn't been enabled. </div> } // Show warning if any of the following features are not enabled if(!feats.IsEnabled(\"PublicEditForm\", \"PublicUploadFiles\")) { <div class=\"alert alert-warning\"> Warning: Edit Form and file upload have not been enabled. </div> } } The code above checks if a feature is enabled, and if not, will show a message to the viewer that this must be enabled first. What you Need To Know The (new) API lies in the namespace ToSic.Sxc.Services - see IFeaturesService The IFeaturesService will do the checks for you ATM the public API has the following commands Enabled(string nameId) which checks if a feature is enabled based on the name Enabled(string nameId, nameId) use with more parameters Enabled(string nameId, nameId, nameId, ...) use with as many parameters a you want Enabled(string[] nameIds) use with string-array Finding Feature NameIds and GUIDs As of v13 we always recommend using the NameIds since they are easier to read. These features are currently managed: PasteImageFromClipboard - enables paste image from clipboard in the TinyMCE editor WysiwygPasteFormatted - enables paste formatted text in the TinyMCE editor PublicEditForm - enables the form to open up for non-editors (to use as input dialogs) - security will still be checked based on config, so it's safe PublicUploadFiles - allows public (non-editors) to upload files (types will still be checked), so it's safe SaveInAdamApi - enables the SaveInAdam API in the WebAPIs PermissionCheckUsers - enables you to set permissions for specific users (by default you can only set by standard roles like Admin, etc.) PermissionCheckGroups - enables you to set permissions for specific groups (by default you can only set by standard roles like Admin, etc.) WebFarmCache - enables the enterprise WebFarmCache (requires a license) Read also ...

    "keywords": "Responsive Images API in .net Creating perfect responsive images can be really hard. Aspects which are covered Creating img tags with perfect srcsets Creating picture tags with perfect source tags for each appropriate format and size Automatically using [Settings] to create the predefined sizes... ...or manually specify other sizes Example @using ToSic.Sxc.Services; @{ var imgService = GetService<IImageService>(); var blogPic = imgService.Picture(blogPost.Image); } @blogPic TODO: LINK TO EXAMPLES How This Works Internally this is what will happen: The format of the file is checked, to detect if other formats could be converted to (like jpg cound also be webp) If no settings are provided, the default settings for content-images are used (see below) If no srcSet is provided, the default from the settings are used (see below) It will then generate a ResponsivePicture object which you can just show, or do more things with (see below) Guide Basic 1. Prepare Always start by getting the IImageService - you will usually just get this once per Razor template: var imgService = GetService<ToSic.Sxc.Services.IImageService>(); If needed, prepare resize settings using the ResizeSettings(...). This is probably only needed in ca. 10% of all cases, because the defaults are usually what you want to use. If you want to do this, see further explanations further down. 2. Get the Responsive Object Get the responsive Image or Picture using the Img(...) or Picture(...). // Example for a file in the App folder var appIconImg = imgService.Img(App.Path + \"/app-icon.png\"); var appIconPicture = imgService.Picture(App.Path + \"/app-icon.png\"); // Example for an image on a dynamic-data object var blogPicImg = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image); 3. Output When creating the HTML you have many options. The most basic is just to show the result: @appIconImg @appIconPicture Guide Advanced Resize Settings If no settings are provided, the Settings.Images.Content see settings will be used automatically. The most common scenario is that you have a razor template which shows images that are typically half or a third the size of the normal content. In such a case you would also supply a factor in various possible formats. Here some examples: var blogPicImgHalf = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image, factor: 0.5); var blogPicImgThird = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image, factor: \"1/3\"); var blogPicImg2Thirds = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image, factor: \"2:3\"); You can also use other settings, like Settings.Images.Screen for larger settings. This can also be combined with factor - here's an example: var background = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image, settings: Settings.Images.Screen); var backgroundSmaller = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image, settings: Settings.Images.Screen, factor: 0.9); You can also use custom settings like this: var resizeSettings = imgService.ResizeSettings(width: 1000, quality: 75, aspectRatio: \"16/9\"); var img = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image, settings: resizeSettings); And you can merge standard settings with your custom settings like this: var resizeSettings = imgService.ResizeSettings(settings: Settings.Images.Custom, width: 1000, quality: 75, aspectRatio: \"16/9\"); var img = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image, settings: resizeSettings); Image alt Description or class Attribute These are the most common things you may want to specify, so the Img(...) and Picture(...) tag support this in the initial call: var img = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image, imgAlt: blogPost.Title, imgClass: \"some-class-names\"); Other attributes can be set as well, but it's more complicated. See custom Output below. Custom Output In most cases you'll just want to show the image or picture, like this: @{ var img = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image); var picture = imgService.Picture(blogPost.Image); } @* Now just show them *@ @img @picture But you may need to customize more what the output shows. Let's assume you want to give the <img> and <picture> tag a special id here's what you would do: @{ var img = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image); img.ImgTag.Id(\"mainImg\"); var picture = imgService.Picture(blogPost.Image); picture.ImgTag.Id(\"mainImg\"); picture.PictureTag.Id(\"mainPic\"); } @* Now just show them *@ @img @picture The img and picture variables are IResponsiveImage and IResponsivePicture objects. The ImgTag and PictureTag properties are RazorBlade objects and can be customized using the RazorBlade fluid Tag API. In case you want even more control over your output, you can also piece it together yourself: @{ var img = imgService.Img(blogPost.Image); var picture = imgService.Picture(blogPost.Image); } @* Show the Image with some custom changes *@ @img.Id(\"imgId\").Style(\"width: 33%\") @* Show your own Image tag *@ <img src=\"@img.Url\" srcset=\"@img.SrcSet\" alt=\"some alt text\"> @* Show the picture with some custom changes on the <picture> *@ @picture.PictureTag.Id(\"picId\") @* Show the picture with some custom changes on the <picture> and <img> *@ @{ picture.PictureTag.Id(\"picId\"); picture.ImgTag.Style(\"width: 30%\"); } @picture @* Piece together your own responsive picture tag simple option *@ <picture> @picture.SourceTags @picture.ImgTag.Style(\"width: 30%\") </picture> @* Piece together your own responsive picture tag simple option *@ <picture> @picture.SourceTags <img src=\"@picture.Url\" style=\"width: 30%\"> </picture> @* Piece together your own responsive picture tag simple option *@ <picture> @foreach(var source in picSet.SourceTags){ @source.Sizes(\"some-sizes\") } <img src=\"@picture.Url\" style=\"width: 30%\"> </picture> TODO: document recipe system What you Need To Know The (new) API lies in the namespace ToSic.Sxc.Services - see ToSic.Sxc.Services The IImageService will do all the magic - see IImageService History Introduced in 2sxc 13.01"

Tip If you are new to responsive images, we suggest you read the MDN Guide to get familiar with this The Responsive Images API generates these automatically for you. In many cases, the configuration for this comes from the settings - like from Settings.Images.Content. But often you may want to configure it yourself - either by reconfiguring the Settings in the Admin-UI, or by supplying in in the code. Concept The way the generator works is that you give it the rules you want based on 4 options: An exact width in pixels (usually with the w parameter in srcsets) A multiple based on the device pixel density (usually with the x parameter) A smaller size based an a multiple (like half the original if it's half the size) The fallback / default picture Examples 1000w, 800w, 600w, 400w Generate these four widths as exact pixel sizes 1x, 1.5x, 2x Generate these three sizes for screen pixel densities 1*, 0.75*, 0.5*, 0.25* Generate exact pixel sizes based on the initial size, so if the initial image was 1200px, it is the same as 1200w, 800w, 600w, 400w d Generate a default line (without any w or x specifier) A lot is auto-detected, so if you want to, you can leave away the w and x and * in almost all cases. So this is valid too (see below for auto-detection rules): 1000, 800, 600, 400 1, 1.5, 2 1*, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 (empty string) - defaults to d In addition to the standard factor you can also set what size should be used exactly - otherwise it's auto-calculated: 1x=1200, 1.5x=1800, 2x=2400, 2.5x=2400, 3x=2400 1000=1000, 1600=1200 1x=1200:600, 1.5x=1800:600, 2x=2400:600 - height can also be set SrcSet Parameter Specs It is always one or more values, separated by a comma , Each value has a number like 1, 1.5, 1200 or a fraction like 1/2 or 1:2 - or empty for d (default) Each value can have a specifier like w, x, * or d - or it's auto detected It can be followed by an = to specify exact resizing rules After the = it can have a width After that it can have a : followed by the resize height Auto Detected Types w, x, * and d These are the rules if the type is not specified: If the number is smaller than 1 it must be a multiplier of the original size, so * is assumed If the number is written as a fraction like 2/3 or 4:3 it is assumed to be a multiplier * If the number is greater than 1 and less than 10 a pixel density is assumed x If the number is 10 or greater than width is assumed w If nothing (not even a number) is specified, default d is assumed History Introduced in 2sxc 13.01"

    "keywords": "Logging in 2sxc / EAV This should give you some minimal guidance into logging what your code does. The General Concept Most objects have a Log where the add notes what they are doing When objects create child-objects they link their logs so that we have a call hierarchy Most calls in the objects will declare that they opened a function, log that, and log the result or a comment With this we can easily see what the code did in the Insights. How to Use in Your Code We strongly suggest that you use the same concepts in your code. You'll have to look at the 2sxc/EAV source in Github to discover more. Use on Object Object Creation All objects which have a log, have a Log property which you can use to add notes. This is the most common way to log. Normally they will inherit from: ToSic.Lib.Services.ServiceBase This is for services which have a few dependencies. ToSic.Lib.Services.ServiceBase<Dependencies> This is for services which have a lot of dependencies. In this case you'll have to pass the dependencies to the base class. Dependencies usually inherit from ToSic.Lib.Services.ServiceDependencies. ToSic.Lib.Services.HelperBase This is for helpers which are not services and will usually be created in code (not from DI). You can also just create normal objects and implement ToSic.Lib.Logging.IHasLog. Note that if you're inheriting from ServiceBase<Dependencies> then the dependencies class should inherit from ToSic.Lib.Services.DependenciesBase. Log Linking For optimal log structures, they should be linked together. This helps to show the call hierarchy in the Insights. This is fully automated, if you adhere to the conventions. It works as follows: Any object inheriting from ServiceBase should call ConnectServices in the constructor. TODO: EXAMPLE Any object inheriting from ServiceBase<Dependencies> should pass the dependencies into the base constructor. The dependencies are then available on a Deps property. For this to work, the Dependencies should inherit from ServiceDependencies and in the constructor call ConnectServices. Logging Basic Messages You can log messages with the following methods (they are kept very short to keep the code compact): Log.A - add a message Log.W - add a warning Log.E - add an error All of these methods have a first string parameter containing the message to add. They also all have an optional parameter called timer. If this is set to true using timer: true then the log will also contain the time it took to execute the method. Exceptions You can log exceptions with the following methods: Log.Ex - add an exception Log Properties Properties use getters and setters. To log these, you must consider a few aspects: do you want to log every single get/set? Or just the first one? do you want to log both get/set or just one of them? To do this, you have 3 tools at your disposal: Getter(() => result) - this will log the result of the getter Setter(() => result) - this will log the result of the setter Create a GetOnce<T> helper and on the get include the Log - this will only log the initial creation / get of the result Log Methods, Functions, Properties TODO: History Introduced in 2sxc 9.6 Added 2sxc Insights (server-side) v9.31 Major enhancements in v10.22 Moved to ToSic.Lib.Logging in v15.0"

It's still fairly basic, so there are some hoops to jump through, but for now it's the recommended way to work with this. Tip Andrew Hoefling wrote a comprehensive guide how to use Dependency Injection in Dnn. Important You need Dnn 9.4+ for these examples to work. 2sxc 13 will only support this form of providing services outside of 2sxc, so if you need this, make sure you upgrade. What works, and what doesn't All 2sxc services can be accessed via DI from Dnn code that support DI - such as themes and modules 2sxc has a full API to provide rendered Blocks, Services and Data to Dnn code Some - but only a few - of Dnn Services are available on DI How Can I Get Dnn Objects using Dependency Injection? As of Dnn 9.10 the answer is mostly no 😶. Dnn is simply not there yet. Work-in-progress. The documentation is almost non-existant, so if you want to try using Dnn objects, you'll need to dig through Dnn code to get this to fly.

Sometimes you want to leverage 2sxc to create a solution, provide data input etc. but want to output or re-use the data in your own Module, Skin, Script or something else. This is easy to do. Important We massively improved this in 2sxc 13 which integrates with Dnn 9 Dependency Injection. These examples require Dnn 9.5+ and 2sxc 14+ Dnn Platform API Basics In general, everything in 2sxc is the same for all platforms. For Dnn it's important to realize that its based on some older Frameworks .net Framework 4.7.2 as of DNN 9.6.1, or .net Framework 4.8 for the latest DNN Razor uses the fairly old MVC 3 C# is also an older version, we believe ca. 6.0. For example, you cannot use var x = x?.y?.z because it's not supported in this version. Dependency Injection is still fairly new in DNN not all DNN services are available in dependency injection not all DNN controls can use dependency injection certain uses of dependency injection cause some surprises With this in mind, let's see how we can solve some common challenges. Use Dnn Objects and Services in 2sxc General user, site (portal) and similar information Just use the CmsContext objects - eg. CmsContext.User or CmsContext.Site This is the same across platforms, so code written like this will also run on Oqtane Access really specific DNN objects Use the normal DNN API which is not dependency injection based. For most objects you will use the old static API to get the Current objects. For example, to get the current portal, use PortalSettings.Current Some objects can also be retrieved through Dependency Injection, using GetService<ISomeDnnType>() In general we recommend against using DNN specific objects this, because your work can then not be transported to another platform. Get DNN SQL Data Use standard DNN APIs You can also use Visual Query to retrieve data from DNN tables Use 2sxc Objects and Services in Dnn Skins and Modules 👉🏽 See Guide to using 2sxc in Dnn Skins and Modules History 2sxc v1 was for Dnn 4 in 2012 2sxc v14 requires Dnn 9.6.1 or newer and is fully integrated in the DNN Dependency injection, so DNN can get 2sxc services and vice versa.

    "keywords": "Use 2sxc Data, Services or Output in Dnn Themes/Skins and Modules Sometimes you want to render a 2sxc Block into a Theme or another Module - or just use 2sxc Data and services. In general this is a two step process: Get the current Service Provider (with the right Scope) from DNN or HttpContext and ask for the specific service you need Use the service Step 1: Get the Service Provider The service provider is the object which knows how to create all the services. It will retrieve any services that have been registered before - including all public 2sxc services. It's important to know about the scope of the service provider. Basically there is a global scope, which is doesn't know about the current page or module. Then there is a current scope which is the scope of the current page or module. So if you ask the global scope for a service, that service will not know about the current user permissions or what page the code is running on. Dnn creates an own scope for each page request, and places it on the HttpContext. The \"real\" way to get it is fairly difficult, so 2sxc provides a shortcut using this.GetScopedService<T> (docs). Here's an example how to get it in a Theme/Skin or Module: <%@ Import Namespace=\"ToSic.Sxc.Services\" %> <script runat=\"server\"> protected override void OnPreRender(EventArgs e) { base.OnPreRender(e); var renderService = this.GetScopedService<IRenderService>(); } </script> Note: if you want to know the hard way, it's documented here for themes and here for modules. Step 2: Do something with the Service Example 1: Render a Block This is the most common use-case: you want to render a 2sxc Block into a Theme or Module. <%@ Import Namespace=\"ToSic.Sxc.Services\" %> <script runat=\"server\"> public dynamic blockHtml; protected override void OnPreRender(EventArgs e) { base.OnPreRender(e); int pageId = 42; int moduleId = 242; blockHtml = this.GetScopedService<ToSic.Sxc.Services.IRenderService>().Module(pageId, moduleId); } </script> <%= blockHtml %> What's important: The blockHtml variable is a dynamic object - this just makes it easier to code. You could specify the type ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.IBlock but that adds complexity. Internally the blockHtml could do a bit more, but that's not relevant for this scenario. Retrieving the blockHtml it inside the OnPreRender event is important, because it ensures that any side-effects such as adding JS/CSS to the page work. Example 2: Get data in a DNN Razor File Imagine you have a theme using DDR Menu with Razor Templates. The theme has a MegaMenu and you want to include one or more featured links that will change often and those links are easily managed in the Content App using the Links Content-Type with any of the default Views.

Your code could differ depending on where you place it (.cs file, .ascx file, etc.) using ToSic.Sxc.Services; var dynCodeSvc = this.GetScopedService<IDynamicCodeService>(); // the app id var appId = 42; // create a simple app object to then access data var appSimple = dynCodeSvc.App(appId); // example getting all data of content type Tag var tags = appSimple.Data[\"Tag\"]; // example accessing a query var tagsSorted = appSimple.Query[\"Tags sorted\"]; // Creating an entity var vals = new Dictionary<string, object>(); vals.Add(\"Tag\", \"test-tag\"); vals.Add(\"Label\", \"Test Tag\"); App.Data.Create(\"Tag\", vals); History 2sxc v1 was for Dnn 4 in 2012 External use API for DNN Introduced in 2sxc 08.03 Old API archived for v13 - see old Dnn Factory Docs Created new IDynamicCodeService in v13 2sxc v14 requires Dnn 9.6.1 or newer and is fully integrated in the DNN Dependency injection, so DNN can get 2sxc services and vice versa.

If you think you need the Dnn property, best first check if the CmsContext can't be used instead. Otherwise inherit from Custom.Dnn.Razor12 and just get the Services you need with GetService. Custom.Hybrid.Razor12 This is the newest base class and was introduced in 2sxc 12. It contains the features which will work cross-platform on both Dnn and Oqtane. You should use this base class to create solutions / Apps which work on Dnn and Oqtane. Limitations of Custom.Hybrid.Razor12 Since this base class is meant to work on both Dnn and Oqtane, it only supports features which both of these platforms support. The property Dnn doesn't exist on this base class, as it would lead to code which can't run cross-platform As of now the properties / methods CustomizeData(...), CustomizeSearch(...) and Purpose do not work, because Oqtane doesn't have a search indexer. We plan on introducing something like this once Oqtane provides search, but as of now it's not yet clear how this would work. The code-behing Code object doesn't work, as we probably cannot implement this in .net 5 The CreateInstance(...) works only on C# files .cs but not with CSHTML files .cshtml as this probably won't work in .net 5 Koi works differently than before. Previously you just used a global object Connect.Koi.Koi to use Koi, but because .net 5 should really use dependency injection, you should now get Koi using GetService<Connect.Koi.ICss>(). The old mechanism will still work in Dnn but would not work in Oqtane. Platform Differences Internally Custom.Hybrid.Razor12 is built on the Razor base classes of the .net frameworks, so in Dnn it builds on #todoc while in Oqtane it builds on #todoc. Because of this, certain features will work in Dnn which don't work in Oqtane and vice versa. If you only want to create Oqtane stuff only, you can just go ahead and use all the new features of the Razor in .net 5 If you plan on creating real hybrid stuff, you will have to do some testing to ensure you didn't use features that don't exist on the other side If you need to code something which is different in each platform, use the #if preprocessor statements Some core feature differences Feature Dnn Oqtane Comments @inherits ✅ ✅ @helper ✅ ⛔ Doesn't exist in .net 5 @model ⛔ ✅ Doesn't exist in old .net #todoc ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent todo #todoc The old one... todo: #todoc Internal Docs: Api Controller Inheritance Warning This is internal documentation for the 2sxc core developers.

    "title": "Razor Templates - Code-Behind | 2sxc 16 / EAV 16",
    "keywords": "Razor Templates - Code-Behind Warning The code-behind feature has been deprecated but will continue to work for older code. So it will only work if you inherit from ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent. If you use any of the newer v12 or v14 base classes, you should either use shared C# or partial views using @Html.Partial(\"_something.cshtml\"). 2sxc 11 introduces a new way to split out most of the C# code from the main template Razor file. We call this code-behind. Best watch the video to get the idea. You can also see a live demo in the Dnn Tutorials. Discover More in the Razor Tutorials We have an rich series of Razor tutorials. You should really check them out 👍. How Code Behind Works Just create another file with the identical name as your main Razor file, but with .code.cshtml as the extension. So you'll then have something like: _My Message.cshtml (the Razor file) Inherits ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent _My Message.code.cshtml (the new code ) The code file looks just like a normal razor file. Must inherit from ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponentCode. Here's an example of such a _My Message.code.cshtml: @inherits ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponentCode @functions { public string Hello() { return \"Hello from inner code\"; } } @helper ShowDiv(string message) { <div>@message</div> } @helper AppName() { <div>App Name is: @App.Name</div> } This is automatically compiled for you and provided to the _My Message.cshtml on the object Code so you can write this code: @inherits ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent <h1>Demo Code Use</h1> <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> Something in it: @Code.Hello() </div> @Code.ShowDiv(\"test helper!\") That's all there is to it 😉 Tip Why would you do this? The main reason is to keep template-html separate from most of the code. This is common when designers like to modify the html but don't like all that programming stuff. Events on Code Behind Files The code-behind also has same methods/events which are automatically called. These methods can be overriden CustomizeData() This has the same effect as overriding CustomizeData in the template file CustomizeSearch(Dictionary<string, List<ISearchItem>> searchInfos, IContainer moduleInfo, DateTime beginDate) This has the same effect as overriding CustomizeSearch in the template file Tip Why would you use this? These methods could always be created in the main Razor file, but it looks daunting to have so much code there. A typical CustomizeSearch is very technical and feels scary to people who just want to change the look and feel. Important: Passing Around Anonymous Objects One of the advanced things you may want to do is have helper functions looking up multiple things, and returning a complex object like this example in the code-behind: @inherits ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponentCode @functions { public dynamic Hello() { return new { Title = \"title\", Message = \"msg\"}; } } Which is used like this @inherits ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent <h1>Demo Code Use</h1> <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> @{ var hello = Code.Hello(); } Something in it: @hello.Title <br> </div> This works and is no big deal, but there are known cases where this breaks, usually with a message like somehing not found on object. The reason is bugs in the .net caching of compiled code, specifically if methods exists in various places with the same name. You can resolve this in 3 ways Restart iis (uncool) Rename the method (ok, bun not sexy) Return a typed object instead of untyped (recommended). In the above example, change to this: @inherits ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponentCode @functions { public class TitleAndMessage { public string Title; public string Message; } public dynamic Hello() { return new TitleAndMessage { Title = \"title\", Message = \"msg\"}; } } History Code-Behind Introduced in 2sxc 11.0 Code-Behind deprecated in 2sxc 12 because it's not compatible with Oqtane"

Notes and Clarifications In general, you can override this event to prepare data. It has a few benefits like It's always called, even if the data is not templated - for example when it's streamed as JSON or when it's prepared for search indexing In the future, most data-preparations will be possible through a visual designer, but for now, this is the best way to go.

How to use In your razor page (.cshtml file) you can add a script block implementing this, as follows: @using ToSic.Eav.Run; @using ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Run; @using ToSic.Sxc.Search; @functions { // this method is optional - your code wouldn't need it, but it's in here to show how it would work together // the CustomizeData would be called first, and potentially modify what is in the Data-object public override void CustomizeData() { // Don't customize anything, nothing to customize in this case } /// <summary> /// Populate the search - ensure that each entity has an own url/page /// </summary> /// <param name=\"searchInfos\"></param> /// <param name=\"moduleInfo\"></param> /// <param name=\"startDate\"></param> public override void CustomizeSearch(Dictionary<string, List<ISearchItem>> searchInfos, IContainer moduleInfo, DateTime beginDate) { foreach (var si in searchInfos[\"Default\"]) { // tell the search system what url it should use in the result si.QueryString = \"mid=\"+ (moduleInfo as DnnContainer).Id + \"&feature=\" + si.Entity.EntityId; } } } The code above will skip customizing any data (but often you would want that too), then CustomizeSearch modifies the list of search-items before they are indexed. How it works In general everything will work automatically. This is what happens: 2sxc will retrieve the data added to this module 2sxc will call the CustomizeData() event if the template has such an event. In this event, your code can add more data to the module as needed. Note that during the search index, no Request-variables exist. So your method will cause an error if it does something like var x = Request[\"Category\"]. In case of an error, the index will still continue to work, but your changes to the data will fail To help you with this, a new property called Purpose was added. It tells you if this view/template was created for displaying or for indexing. 2sxc will then use the data and create SearchItems, ready to index. Each entity will be turned into a SearchItem Each Content-Type will have an own list (so you can differentiate between all the SearchItems for the Categories and the SearchItems for the Questions) Multi-Language is handled correctly, so the English index will contain the English content, etc. 2sxc will then call a CustomizeSearch() event, so your code could provide changes. A common scenario is to say that each entity (say each question) has a different URL (say a details-page). So even though all entities belong to the module (and Dnn only knows of this one module), the module can say that each entity has an own details page. One this is done, the SearchItems are converted to official SearchDocument-objects and handed over to Dnn Read also Purpose - which tells you why the current code is running so you could change the data added CustomizeData Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App FAQ with Categories More links: Description of the feature on 2sxc docs History Introduced in 2sxc 6.2 Added support for newer Dnn versions at a later time - not sure when"

Writing this JS would be complicated to say the least, so the @Edit.TagToolbar(...) and @Edit.Toolbar(...) are your tools of choice for adding toolbars from Razor. Discover More in the Razor Tutorials We have an rich series of Razor tutorials. You should really check them out 👍. How to use Here's a quick example of using the Edit object in a Razor template: <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> @Content.Title </h1> This example will output the item title in an h1 tag and add a hidden, appear-on-mouse-over toolbar with editing-buttons for the item named Content. Let's assume you're building the details-page of a news-app and you only want the edit/remove buttons, to improve the UI for your use case. Additionally, you want the mouse-hover to react on the whole article, not just oven the title. Here's how: Warning 2sxc 10.27 introduces a new, simpler API to customize the toolbar. So the instructions below are technically correct, but not recommended any more. Check out the much simpler toolbar customizations @* this will show an \"edit and remove\" button for the current item *@ <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, actions: \"edit,remove\")> <h1> @Content.Title </h1> @Html.Raw(Content.Body) </div> Here's a different example, how to create a toolbar with only one button, namely an add new item button to create a new BlogPost-item. @* this will show an \"add\" button if the current user is an editor *@ <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\")> @Content.Title </h1> As you can see, the actions: \"new\" tells the toolbar to only show this one button, while the contentType: \"BlogPost\" says what content-type this new item should be. As this toolbar won't have buttons that modify an existing item, it doesn't need that parameter. How it works This command is part of the Edit object and used in Razor templates. It provides a simple API to generate in-page buttons if the current user is an editor. It also checks if edit should be enabled (based on security specs) and will then generate some HTML/JavaScript at that location. Common Tasks Here are a few snippets that you'll typically need, saving you from reading all the docs in common scenarios: Edit.Toolbar(employee) creates a default toolbar for the content-item employee with all default buttons like edit, change-view, more, etc. Edit.Toolbar(employee, actions: \"edit\") creates a toolbar for the item employee but only with the edit-button. Edit.Toolbar(employee, actions: \"edit,add,remove\") creates a toolbar with three buttons edit, add, remove Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\") creates a toolbar with one button, namely new which will open a new BlogPost form. @Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", prefill: new { Title = \"Hello\", Color = \"red\" } ) creates a toolbar with one button, namely new which will open a new BlogPost form, and prefills the Title and Color field. The Toolbar Actions Note: at the moment, the buttons are grouped into bundles like initial buttons list buttons template / view buttons app buttons The actions can be a combination of known button-names. Here's the current JavaScript catalog of commands: The following commands all require target to be set, or they only make sense in a List-setup - see also content and not as data. new open a dialog to create a new item, requires a target or a contentType parameter edit to edit the current item publish will optionally show the publish-button, but only if the current item is not published. add opens a dialog to create a new item just like new, but will add it below the current item in the content list remove will remove (not delete) this item from the content list moveup will move the item up one position in the content list movedown will move the item down one position in the content list sort will open the sort dialog of the content list replace will open a dialog to swap the current item in the content list Note: the command metadata - is a bit special, not supported in the actions parameter - use the complex toolbar: instead and read the instructions for the JS Commands. For many more commands you should check the JS Commands), which covers many more like app-import, layout, develop, contenttype, contentitems, app, zone, more etc. More About the Prefill Basically this is a .net object which will be serialized to JSON and used to prefill a new item. Usually you'll just create a new, anonymous object like new { Title = \"xyz\", Date = ... }. example @Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", prefill: new { Title = \"Hello\", Color = \"red\", Link = \"page:\" + Dnn.Tab.TabID } ) This example will prefill the title, the color and in the link field add a reference to the current page. Multiple Entities Prefil For this you must simply provide an array of strings, like this: @Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", prefill: new { Tags = new string[] {\"08387a10-1aac-494a-9eb5-1383e31490eb\",\"b498a694-047a-4e51-a285-50f9a64edda1\"} }) Styling the Toolbar As of now there are only limited stying functions: Floating the Toolbar This happens automatically, if a surrounding HTML-tag has a class \"sc-element\". more... What Really Happens with the toolbar As previously noted, the toolbar actually puts some html/js into the page, which the javascript $2sxc object will pick up and work with. Quite a lot happens on the client, and that will be documented some other day. Here just the short version: js runs, picks up Toolbars jc reviews DOM to see what context it's in (either the module-instance or an inner-content) js generates buttons if a button is clicked, an action-manager then executes the correct action on the correct item Older @Content.Toolbar Syntax Is Deprecated Note: there was an older @SomeContentItem.Toolbar syntax and this still works, but we ran into architecture issues, so we decided to place all advanced functions into the Edit.Toolbar(...) method. This is the way to go from now on, the old syntax will continue to work but is not recommended any more.

This would result in files such as _Default.cshtml. This is because IIS will not run any razor files with an underscore, so if a user (or an attacker) would try: https://yourdomain.com/_default.cshtml ...the code would not run. Basically IIS does not run any Razor files with a leading underscore. In addition to that, such files would not be added to the page-tree when creating menus in asp.net MVC. This makes sense in asp.net MVC. Underscore not Relevant for 2sxc In 2sxc the Razor files themselves cannot be accessed. DNN doesn't have a handler for .cshtml files Oqtane has the files in a protected location which is not publicly available All 2sxc Razor files inherit from a custom class, which makes them unusable if called directly Spaces in File Names You can use spaces in file names. All of the following are valid: I Like Spaces.cshtml IDontLikeSpaces.cshtml I-Would-Rather-use-dashes.cshtml Tip The 2sxc Recommendation for Razor files is to use spaces. We believe it makes the files/folders easier to skim in a code editor. Casing You can use any casing you prefer. All of the following are valid: My Razor File.cshtml myrazorfile.cshtml MyRazorFile.cshtml Tip The 2sxc Recommendation for Razor files is to start with upper case. If you do not use spaces in your file names, you should use PascalCase. Naming Partial Files Partial Razor files are called by other files to render parts. A common use case is a sub-template for a complex item in a list. You can name this anyhow you want. But we recommend that parts are named in a way that makes it obvious... ... that they are a part ... if they are shared, or just used by a single other Razor Tip The 2sxc Recommendation is to use the term Part for partial files. We suggest Part User Info.cshtml for parts which are used by many files We suggest [originalfile].part.cshtml for parts which are only used by a single file"

    "keywords": "Hybrid Razor running on Dnn ☢️ and Oqtane 🩸 Dnn and Oqtane have a few differences because of these important factors: Different underlying C# and .net frameworks and Razor-Engines Different platforms (Dnn is different from Oqtane) Important This is very advanced stuff and only relevant if you want to create Apps which run on both Dnn and Oqtane. For most of your apps this is not relevant 2sxc Philosophy - Stay out of the Way Our philosophy is to not reinvent the wheel so it's important that we let you use the .net APIs as they are designed. Se we don't plan on creating another API which to hide the differences, but let you understand them and easily handle everything as needed. Core Strategies for Hybrid Razor Templates If you follow these three rules you should be good to go: Inherit from Custom.Hybrid.Razor12 Use very common C# features and syntaxes which existed since C# 7.2 (so anything that runs in Dnn will also run in Oqtane) Use .net standard 2.0 APIs and avoid using System.Web Where necessary, use preprocessor directives as explained below Avoid old Razor Features The old razor had a few features which won't work in .net Core 5 / Oqtane: @helper directive Switch between Code variations in Razor In Oqtane 2 we recommended using #if NETCOREAPP switches in your Razor code. In Oqtane 3, this only works in .cs files. So the only way to switch between code variations in the latest Razor is to use normal @if(...) statements and place your platform specific code in sub-files. @if(CmsContext.Platform.Name == \"Oqtane) { // OqtaneStuff which doesn't trigger compile errors can be inline someVar = \"Oqtane\"; // Code which would trigger compile errors must be in a separate file @Html.Partial(\"OqtaneCode.cshtml\"); } else { // DnnStuff - same principles } The Preprocessor Directives in .cs files C# has special #if preprocessor statements which are evaluated during compilation. Using this you can define which code should be used in Dnn and Oqtane. #if NETCOREAPP // OqtaneStuff #else // DnnStuff #endif The following symbols are set when Api Controllers are compiled: Key True for Dnn True for Oqtane Comments NETCOREAPP ⛔ ✅ Only works in WebAPIs and code (.cs) OQTANE ⛔ ✅ Only works in WebAPIs and code (.cs) Important: These don't work in Razor on Oqtane 3+ because we cannot activate these in the compiler - so they only work in .cs files Different C# and .net Frameworks Part Dnn 7 Dnn 9 Oqtane C# Language ca. 7 ca. 7 C# 9 .net Framework 4.5.1 4.7.2 .net core 5 .net Standard 1.6 2.0 2.0 Any hybrid controller must limit itself to features in .net standard 1.6 or 2.0, depending on the platforms you want to support. Note that any 2sxc standard apps are meant to still run in Dnn 4.7.2, so we'll restrict our work to support .net standard 1.6. This means our examples are more limited than what you will be doing. Differences in the Platforms If you are creating hybrid controllers, we'll assume that you usually don't need to access properties of Dnn or Oqtane. If you do, you'll have to use the standard mechanisms provided by these. In Dnn - use global objects like PortalSettings.Current In Oqtane use Dependency Injection To avoid the code from causing trouble during compilation, wrap the necessary differences in #if NETCOREAPP ... #endif and #if !NETCOREAPP ... #endif blocks in C# To avoid the Razor from causing trouble during compilation, wrap the necessary differences in @if(CmsContext.Platform.Name == \"Oqtane\") { ... } blocks in Razor Limitations for @using Statements The Razor Compiler in Dnn & Oqtane behave a bit differently regarding preprocessor statements. So you cannot use them for @using ... statements. This WILL NOT WORK: @{#if unknown} @using DotNetNuke.Framework.JavaScriptLibraries; @{#endif} In Dnn it will work, but in Oqtane / .net 5 it will not result in an error, because the @using statements are handled in a way which doesn't result in them being skipped. If you only need the namespace on a single command, just use the full namespace in your command, like this: if(fancybox || scripts) { #if(CmsContext.Platform.Name == \"Dnn\") { // Put this line in a separate file to call from here // DotNetNuke.Framework.JavaScriptLibraries.JavaScript.RequestRegistration(DotNetNuke.Framework.JavaScriptLibraries.CommonJs.jQuery); } } If you have complex code, a simple trick is to place it in a separate file (so the Razor compiler won't complain) and then use CreateInstance(...) or Html.Partial(...) to call that if you are in the correct system. Set Page Properties and Headers for Hybrid Apps In Dnn you were able to use RazorBlade to set Title or add Headers. Since RazorBlade has a static implementation, this cannot work in Oqtane. To solve this we created the IPageService. Set Http Status Codes for Hybrid Apps In Dnn you could simply get the HttpContext and change the Response object. This uses a static implementation which dosen't work in Oqtane. To solve this we created the IPageService. Search Integration Previously in Dnn you could write some CustomizeSearch code in the Razor-file which we decided to deprecate in future. From now on please use the the feature described here. Note that as of now, Oqtane doesn't have a search indexer, so there it will simply have no effect, but your code will run on both platforms. History Introduced in 2sxc 12.00"

We try very hard to ensure that old APIs still work - so most of the APIs you'll see here will actually continue to work, but you shouldn't use them as they fall into one of these categories: A better solution / API has been created Other new features are not compatible with the old implementation Older implementations may stop working some day Since you may still have code which uses these APIs you may want to fix something or migrate them to something newer. That's what this page is meant for. Data and Search Customization This section only applies to Dnn, as Oqtane doesn't have a search index built it yet. 👉 Read about Search Customization to discover how it should be done today. Evolution of Customizing Search Let's begin with the Evolution of Customizing Search as it helps to understand how this feature developed. First Implementation in 2sxc 6 The initial versions of 2sxc didn't offer this feature, it was added in v6. At that time, the idea was that you would create special functions in your Razor files which contained the logic for customizing the results. The methods used were CustomizeData and CustomizeSearch. That mechanism still works and you'll find it in many older apps, but we strongly discourage it's use. Neutralizing Changes in 2sxc 10 In 2sxc v10 we created a new improved base class for Razor files called RazorComponent and used the opportunity to improve the signature of the API because the original implementation used some Dnn objects, and we anticipated that we would make this available for other platforms as well. This was a minor change. It still works today, but we discourage it's use. Code Behind in 2sxc 11 Razor Files were getting very technical if they had this code, and we decided there must be a better way to do this. We invented the concept of Code Behind and let developers place the logic there. This was a major improvement, but still not perfect. We discourage it's use. Separate Search-Customization in 2sxc 12 When we finally implemented 2sxc for Oqtane we realized that our concept still had weaknesses: Razor files containing search-customization code were confusing Token templates were not able to customize their search result Search customizations may vary between platforms (and some may not offer search at all) Having the code in the Razor-file actually caused problem when creating hybrid apps Often customize search was used for simply disabling search results - which was overkill and confusing If many Views needed the same customizations it was hard to share the code Because of this we decided to change the implementation completely. As of 2sxc v12 the search customization happens in a special code file which can be anywhere in your App. Your view is then configured to use that code. 👉 Use the new mechanisms explained in Search Customizations"

You should really check them out 👍. Recommended Methods v12+ Reuse a Partial View with @Html.Partial(...) v12+ Razor templates can include other razor files with more Razor code inside them, using Html.Partial(\"_Something.cshtml\"). This is a standard asp.net function to render another Razor file where you need it. You usually use it to make small component Razor files which might just show a button or something, and then call that file. You can find examples in the tutorials Share a .cs File as Library v10+ Sometimes you want to share C# code which isn't meant for HTML-output. For example, a security check. You can do this using CreateInstance(...). If you: need to share code with razor and Webapi don't need razor specific features like @helper You can create a .cs class file and share this across razor files AND WebAPI files. To use it, you need something like: @{ var helper = CreateInstance(\"_Helper.cs\"); } Tip The helper file should ideally inherit from Custom.Hybrid.Code14 (or similar base classes). in which case it will have have the same full APIs incl. the App and Content object just like the main file. 👉🏼 See examples in the tutorials Reuse a Template Delegate Function generating HTML v5+ Template Delegates are a very old Razor feature, but they are quite hard to use. They are similar to @helpers but work in both Oqtane and DNN. 👉🏼 See tutorial example. Older / Alternative Methods (DNN only) Reuse Snippets with @helper in Razor Razor has a @helper syntax which allows you to create fragments and re-use them. 👉🏼 Discover this in the tutorials. This will not work in Oqtane, as the newer Razor engines don't support this. Reuse a Partial View with @RenderPage() @RenderPage(...) does the same thing as @Html.Partial(...) (see above) but it will only work on DNN, not Oqtane. Share a .cshtml File as Library of Sub-Templates When you have a lot of components it may be easier to create a library of @helper commands. This library is just a normal .cshtml file - usually in a folder called shared or something, and you can then call these snippets and helpers from all your template files. To use it, you need something like: @{ var helper = CreateInstance(\"_Helper.cshtml\"); } 👉🏼 See examples in the tutorials Razor Code-Behind If your Razor file is getting kind of large because of C# functions, best place it in a Razor Code-Behind.

You should really check them out 👍. Concept A Razor template is standalone - the page requests that it's rendered, but there is no official way to also tell the page that the title should change or that certain headers must be set. We approached it in a futuristic way because we wanted to make sure that the code you write works in Dnn and Oqtane. So here's how it works Your code will get a IPageService object using `GetService<IPageService>() Your code can then tell it what you need - like SetTitle(...) or AddJsonLd(...) Once the Razor is done, the engine will forward these requests to the page and ensure it happens 👉 Read about Dependency Injection 👉 Read about the IPageService in the API docs Set Page Properties You can set these page properties SetTitle(newToPrefix) SetTitle(newTitle, placeholder) see docs SetDescription(newDescription) SetDescription(newDescription, placeholder) see docs SetKeywords(additionalKeywords) SetKeywords(additionalKeywords, placeholder) see docs SetBase(url) - see docs Note that SetTitle, SetDescription and SetKeywords will prepend or append whatever you give them to the existing value, unless you specify a placeholder - in which case that placeholder will be replaced. Set Http Response Codes In some cases an App may need to set the page to 404 - so that google doesn't index it. Do this using SetHttpStatus(statusCode, optionalmessage) - see docs Note: ATM this is Dnn ☢️ only, as Oqtane doesn't render each page at a time - so a status code wouldn't work there (yet). Add Icons and Icon-Sets like FavIcon Icons / FavIcons are minor enhancements to a page, but they serve more than just the icon in the browser tab. In many cases they may also have larger images used for tiles and more. Use these two commands to get them working: AddIcon - see docs to add a single icon AddIconSet - see docs to add a bundle of icons for various use cases in one step Add Custom Headers Custom headers may be important for JavaScripts running on your page or other special purposes. Set them using these methods: AddToHead(string) - see docs AddToHead(tag) - see docs AddMeta(name, content) - see docs Add JsonLD Headers (Schema.org) JsonLD is a powerful way to describe your page to other systems, especially web crawlers like Google. It uses conventions from schema.org. Use this to add custom JsonLD headers: AddJsonLd(jsonString) - see docs AddJsonLd(jsonObject) - see docs Add OpenGraph Headers OpenGraph is a standard to describe your page for Facebook, Twitter and other more social-style systems. It adds meta headers using og: prefixes.

It's meant for customizing the internal indexer of the platform, _not_ for Google Search. To use it, create a custom code (.cs) file which implements ICustomizeSearch interface. You can also inherit from a DynamicCode base class (like Code12) if you need more functionality. For more guidance on search customizations, see https://go.2sxc.org/customize-search */ public class SearchMapper : Custom.Hybrid.Code12, ICustomizeSearch { /// <summary> /// Populate the search /// </summary> /// <param name=\"searchInfos\">Dictionary containing the streams and items in the stream for this search.</param> /// <param name=\"moduleInfo\">Module information with which you can find out what page it's on etc.</param> /// <param name=\"beginDate\">Last time the indexer ran - because the data you will get is only what was modified since.</param> public void CustomizeSearch(Dictionary<string, List<ISearchItem>> searchInfos, IModule moduleInfo, DateTime beginDate) { // Set this to true if you want to see logs of this search in the insights // Only do this while developing, otherwise you'll flood the logs and never see the important parts Log.Preserve = false; foreach (var si in searchInfos[\"AllPosts\"]) { var entity = AsDynamic(si.Entity); si.Title = \"Title: \" + entity.Title; si.QueryString = \"details=\" + entity.UrlKey; } // Remove not needed streams var keys = searchInfos.Keys.ToList(); foreach (var key in keys) { if (key != \"AllPosts\") { searchInfos.Remove(key); } } } } Basics to get Right The File name can be anything you want, but the class name must match it. Your code can be a simple C# class, but we recommend it inherits from Custom.Hybrid.Code12 ...because you then also get more objects like App or CmsContext You can also inherit from Custom.Dnn.Code12 which would give you the Dnn object but we don't suggest it, because you should use the CmsContext where possible. Your class must implement ToSic.Sxc.Search.ICustomizeSearch to inform the compiler that it can help with search mapping You must then implement public void CustomizeSearch(...) as shown in the example Understanding Search-Mapping Your code will receive the data which would otherwise just be passed to the Dnn Indexer. You can then modify it as you want and make changes like: Remove streams from the dictionary streamInfos - thereby dropping entire sets of Entities Remove Entities in a specific stream Change properties like the Title Change properties like the QueryString - this is great on list views where data is indexed in the list, but the link in the search results should go to a details page. Develop Search Customizations To create your search indexing code you'll probably need to tweak and test a few times. Note that the 2sxc Blog App shows you a real-life example of Search-Customizations. So once you've configured a View to use a custom Search-Mapper your work will usually consist of doing the following Making some changes Going into the Dnn Admin and flushing the search-index Then run the indexer and wait till it's completed Check the results or debug issues using the Dnn Events-Log or 2sxc Insights (see below) Debugging Search Indexing Two tools will help you to debug issues 1. Dnn Events Log Really bad issues (like if your code cannot compile) will be logged in the Dnn Events. So if your code isn't even running, check that. 2. 2sxc Insights 2sxc Insights will help you see what's happening exactly in your code when you need it. Warning By default the search index will not log its work in the Insights, because it would flood the logs and you wouldn't find the occurances which you need. Because of this, logging is disabled by default, and your code can activate it using Log.Preserve = true; Remember to add a bunch of logging like Log.Add(\"Got to here\"); etc. to verify everything works step-by-step. Common Issues Already Indexed Data is not Reindexed Often when you're playing with indexing customizations you'll re-run the indexer and expect to see the changed results - but it's still what was there before. This is because each Entity has a modified timestamp and only changed entities will be re-indexed. This is great for performance, but challenging when making changes. 👉 Remember to flush the Dnn Search Index before re-indexing to really see if your code worked. Search Index and Multilanguage (i18n) It's important to know that on multi-language sites, the module is indexed multiple times for each language. So just be aware of that. This event is called by the view-engine after calling CustomizeData and before passing the Data object to the Dnn Search Indexer. You can override this event to change how data is presented to the search, for example by bundling items together, or by giving items different URLs so that search knows that they are to appear on a sub-page. Discover More in the Razor Tutorials We have an rich series of Razor tutorials. You should really check them out 👍. How to use In your razor page (.cshtml file) you can add a script block implementing this, as follows: @using ToSic.Eav.Run; @using ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Run; @using ToSic.Sxc.Search; @functions { // this method is optional - your code wouldn't need it, but it's in here to show how it would work together // the CustomizeData would be called first, and potentially modify what is in the Data-object public override void CustomizeData() { // Don't customize anything, nothing to customize in this case } /// <summary> /// Populate the search - ensure that each entity has an own url/page /// </summary> /// <param name=\"searchInfos\"></param> /// <param name=\"moduleInfo\"></param> /// <param name=\"startDate\"></param> public override void CustomizeSearch(Dictionary<string, List<ISearchItem>> searchInfos, IContainer moduleInfo, DateTime beginDate) { foreach (var si in searchInfos[\"Default\"]) { // tell the search system what url it should use in the result si.QueryString = \"mid=\"+ (moduleInfo as DnnContainer).Id + \"&feature=\" + si.Entity.EntityId; } } } The code above will skip customizing any data (but often you would want that too), then CustomizeSearch modifies the list of search-items before they are indexed. How it works In general everything will work automatically. This is what happens: 2sxc will retrieve the data added to this module 2sxc will call the CustomizeData() event if the template has such an event. In this event, your code can add more data to the module as needed. Note that during the search index, no Request-variables exist. So your method will cause an error if it does something like var x = Request[\"Category\"]. In case of an error, the index will still continue to work, but your changes to the data will fail To help you with this, a new property called Purpose was added. It tells you if this view/template was created for displaying or for indexing. 2sxc will then use the data and create SearchItems, ready to index. Each entity will be turned into a SearchItem Each Content-Type will have an own list (so you can differentiate between all the SearchItems for the Categories and the SearchItems for the Questions) Multi-Language is handled correctly, so the English index will contain the English content, etc. 2sxc will then call a CustomizeSearch() event, so your code could provide changes. A common scenario is to say that each entity (say each question) has a different URL (say a details-page). So even though all entities belong to the module (and Dnn only knows of this one module), the module can say that each entity has an own details page. One this is done, the SearchItems are converted to official SearchDocument-objects and handed over to Dnn Read also Purpose - which tells you why the current code is running so you could change the data added CustomizeData Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App FAQ with Categories More links: Description of the feature on 2sxc docs History Introduced in 2sxc 6.2 Added support for newer Dnn versions at a later time - not sure when Easier standalone .cs implementation introduced in 2sxc 12"

They give you access to all common services directly, without using GetService<...>(). Standard Services As of 2sxc 13+ we publish all common services for your Razor / C# code on ToSic.Sxc.Services. This helps you figure out what's in the box - just go check it out. How Services Work Technically a service is just a .net object which does stuff for you. You can get Services in your C# code like this: using ToSic.Sxc.Services; var page = GetService<IPageService>(); Internally services may require additional information to work - like the current Page it's on etc. This happens almost by magic thanks to Dependency Injection. If this is new to you, you should read up on it. Integration with Dnn Services Dnn is still new to Dependency Injection. Because of this, there are some limitations if you want to get a Dnn service. For example: It requires that you use Dnn 9.4+ It also requires 2sxc v13 as that now fully integrations with Dnns Service Provider Not all Dnn Objects exist as services. You'll need to browse Dnn code to figure this out. Integration with Oqtane Services Oqtane started as a .net Core project so Dependency Injection is in it's DNA. Anything Oqtane has can be requested as a Service, but there are some caveats: If you're writing Blazor code then most services only exist as a proxy, the real work happens on the backend If you're writing server-side code then most services are available, but the name / signature may be a bit different than the Blazor service Create your own Service 👉 Check out Create Custom C# Services History of Dependency Injection in 2sxc 2sxc introduced Dependency Injection 1.1 in v9 (May 2017) Integrated with Oqtane DI in v12 (May 2021) GetService<T> pattern introduced for Razor/C# in v12 (May 2021) Integrated with Oqtane DI in v12 (May. 2021) Upgraded to Dependency Injection 2.1 in v13 (Dec. 2021) Integrated with Dnn DI in v13 (Dec. 2021) Created ServiceKits for v14 (June 2022)"

The Filter reduces the amount of items shown in a Data-List. It is given to the data command using the filter parameter which is an optional parameter and must be named. filter Parameters The filter can contain multiple filters to filter a list of entities in the admin-UI. You could for example only show all items containing the word something. But the most common case is to restrict entities shown to these having a child-relationship with something else. Example You may have a list of Books and only wish to show all of the books by the Author by the name of Daniel Mettler. You could try to filter by the name, but that's not reliable, so you would usually want to filter by the unique ID of Daniel Mettler. Ways to Set the Filter The following examples assume you're calling .Data on the IToolbarBuilder from the IToolbarService. So typically it would be something like this in front of each line: @Kit.Toolbar.Default().Data(\"Books\", filter: ...); Basic syntax which worked ca. v14.07 // Simple relationship: Author has entity with ID 52 Data(..., filter: \"Author=52\"); // Simple relationship: Author has entity with ID 52 OR 302 Data(..., filter: \"Author=[52,302]\"); // Two filters (AND, so both must match) Data(..., filter: \"Author=52&Publisher=9306\"); // The same as a object Data(..., filter: new { Author = 52, Publisher = 9306 }); Advanced, simpler options requiring v14.07.05 // Values with Arrays automatically get converted Data(..., filter: new { Author = new int[] { 52 } }); Data(..., filter: new { Author = new int[] { 52, 58, 29 } }); // Filter conditions pointing to an Entity var someAuthor = App.Data[\"Author\"].First(); Data(..., filter: new { Author = someAuthor }); // Multiple Authors Data(..., filter: new { Author = new object[] { someAuthor, someAuthor } }); // IEnumerable of Authors var lotsOfAuthors = AsList(App.Data[\"Author\"]).Select(a => a.LastName == \"Mettler\"); Data(..., filter: new { Author = lotsOfAuthors }); See also the JS toolbar docs list of all common UI parameters can be found here"

    "keywords": "Toolbar Builder Guide – Tweak API for Buttons new 15.07 Buttons can be tweaked to change their look and behavior. Previously, this was done using parameters such as ui, parameters, prefill etc. Now, you can use the tweak API to do the same thing. Tip Using the tweak API is the recommended way to tweak buttons. It gives you compile time checking so it's less error-prone. Example // Old way without tweak Kit.Toolbar.Default().Add(ui: \"color=green\", parameters: new { app = 2, zone = 3 }); // New way with tweak - one example Kit.Toolbar.Default().Add(tweak: b => b.Color(\"green\").Parameters(new { app = 2, zone = 3 })); // Or another example Kit.Toolbar.Default().Add(tweak: b => b.Color(\"green\").Parameters(\"app\", 2).Parameters(\"zone\", 3)); How it Works Almost every command on the IToolbarBuilder has a tweak parameter. This parameter is a function which takes a ITweakButton and returns a new one. The ITweakButton itself has a functional API which allows you to chain multiple tweaks. This means when you do this: Kit.Toolbar.Default().Add(tweak: b => b.Color(\"green\").Parameters(\"id\", 93030))); ...it says Take the button b Set the color to green Add the parameter id with the value 93030 Each command returns a fresh ITweakButton with the changes applied using the immutable pattern. So the final result is returned by the function and used by the toolbar builder. Why a New API? The new method achieves the same purpose as the old, and the old way will continue to work indefinitely. But the advantages of the new API are: It's easier to document so it's also easier to discover the possibilities you have It's easier to use because it's more type-safe and less error-prone It's easier to extend - for example with the new note feature added in v15.07 It's safer, for example the API will remove # characters in colors, which would otherwise cause problems API Docs Tweak API See also the JS toolbar docs Important to Know You cannot mix the tweak API with the previous parameters. So if you use tweak on a button, you cannot also use ui or parameters etc. The tweak API is a fluid API, so you can chain multiple tweaks together. The tweak API is immutable, so every step returns a new object. The tweak API is functional. Issues / Challenges The tweak API uses lambda expressions. This can cause problems with dynamic objects which are very common in Razor. If you don't know about dynamics you should briefly google it. Basically the following code will cause issues: // Note that Content is a dynamic object Kit.Toolbar.Default(Content).New(tweak: b => b.Color(\"pink,black\")) This will result in a message like this: ...error CS1978: Cannot use an expression of type 'lambda expression' as an argument to a dynamically dispatched operation at... This means: because the initial part Kit.Toolbar.Default(Content) contains a dynamic parameter (Content), the compiler treats what comes after that as dynamic as well. So the following .New(...) is also treated as dynamic. This is usually not a problem, but the compiler will complain that the inner lambda b => b.Color(\"pink,black\") can't be reliably compiled, since it could be anything. For now, the best workaround is to do one of the following: Tell the compiler that Content is an object Kit.Toolbar.Default(Content as object).New(tweak: b => b.Color(\"pink,black\")) Place the dynamic parameter at the end Kit.Toolbar.Default().New(tweak: b => b.Color(\"pink,black\")).For(Content) This is not ideal, and we're striving for improvements in future releases.

The differences become much more important when you want to do a bit more in your code. This is why it's really ok to just do @itm.Get(\"FirstName\"). But var name = itm.String(\"FirstName\") + \" \" + itm.String(\"LastName\"); is much better. TODO: IsDemoItem etc. Show/Output Complex Values Dynamic Typed Comments / Differences @Html.Raw(dyn.Description) @itm.Html(\"Description\") Show a HTML value with toolbar @Kit.Image.Picture(dyn, \"Pic\") @itm.Picture(\"Pic\") Show an image; auto-resize and toolbar @dyn.Link @itm.Url(\"Link\") Show a link, auto-converts file:72 to url @dyn.Get(\"Link\", convertLinks: false) @itm.String(\"Link\") Show link-string without auto-convert AsAdam(dyn as object, \"Pic\").Files.First() itm.File(\"Pic\") Get a file in the field Pic AsAdam(dyn as object, \"Pic\") itm.Folder(\"Pic\") Get a folder on the item Working with Children and Parents Dynamic Typed Comments / Differences @dyn.Publisher.Name @itm.String(\"Publisher.Name\") @itm.Child(\"Publisher\").String(\"Name\") Show a child value @(dyn.Authors as IEnumerable<dynamic>).Count() @itm.Children(\"Authors\").Count() Show number of children Basic Get-Current-Data These objects/commands get data belonging to this block/instance. Dynamic Typed Comments / Differences Content (dynamic) MyItem (ITypedItem) First/main item List (IEnumerable<dynamic>) MyItems (IEnumerable<ITypedItem>) List of all items Header (dynamic) MyHeader (ITypedItem) Header item Note It's important to understand how data-items can belong to the current block. Basically any data an editor adds to the current block belongs to it. This is different from queried data which doesn't belong to anything. Example: The images in a gallery-block belong to that gallery instance. But the list of all tags don't belong to the gallery instance. The pairs such as Content/MyItem will often contain the same data - but not always. In the old dynamic APIs, Content contained the item belonging to the block, but only if the View was not using a Query. If the view used a query, Content would contain the first item returned by the query. MyItem is different - it always contains the first item belonging to the block. The same difference applies to List vs MyItems. Advanced Get-Current-Data The MyData (previously Data) object contains all data which was prepared for the current block. In very basic scenarios you don't need it, as it contain the same data as the MyItem (previously Content) object and others. As soon as the View is configured to use a Query, it will instead contain the data returned by the query. Dynamic Typed Comments / Differences Data (IContextData) MyData (IContextData) DataSource of query data Data[\"Tags\"] (IDataStream) MyData[\"Tags\"] (IDataStream) Tags Stream of query data Data[\"Tags\"] (IDataStream) MyData.GetStream(\"Tags\") (IDataStream) Recommended way to get stream DataSources and Streams return IEntity objects, and you will usually want to convert them to ITypedItem (or dynamic) objects. This is done with these APIs: Dynamic Typed Comments / Differences AsDynamic(Data) AsItems(MyData) Get list of items in Default stream AsDynamic(Data[\"Tags\"]) AsItems(MyData.GetStream(\"Tags\")) Get list of items in Tags stream AsDynamic(Data[\"Tags\"].List.First()) AsItem(MyData.GetStream(\"Tags\")) Get a single item Get Settings and Resources Dynamic Typed Comments / Differences Settings (dynamic) AllSettings (ITypedStack) All settings Settings.Color (dynamic) AllSettings.String(\"Color\") (string) Get a color setting Resources (dynamic) AllResources (ITypedStack) All resources Resources.Title (dynamic) AllResources.String(\"Title\") (string) Get a resource App.Settings (dynamic) App.Settings (ITypedItem) App settings App.Settings.Color (dynamic) App.Settings.String(\"Color\") (string) App settings App.Resources (dynamic) App.Resources (ITypedItem) App resources App.Resources.Title (dynamic) App.Resources.String(\"Title\") (string) App resources Tip The new AllSettings and AllResources can use paths to deeper values, such as AllSettings.Int(\"Images.Content.Width). This is much safer that the old API, which threw an error if an intermediate setting didn't exist. Access App Data Dynamic Typed Comments / Differences App (IApp) App (IAppTyped) App.Data (IAppData) App.Data (IAppData) (same) App.Data[\"Tags\"] App.Data[\"Tags\"] App.Data.GetStream(\"Tags\") (same) preferred App.Query(\"QName\") App.GetQuery(\"QName\") new method allows for more parameters - App.GetQuery(\"QName\", parameters: new { Id = 7 } ) new only Access App and View Folders / URLs Dynamic Typed Comments / Differences - App.Folder (IFolder) new only App.Folder (string) App.Folder.Name (string) App.Path App.Folder.Url App.PhysicalPath App.Folder.PhysicalPath TODO TOOLBARS Dynamic Typed Comments / Differences Edit Kit.Edit global Edit object is gone Edit.TagToolbar(...)

The API is quite different, so if you copy old snippets you'll probably need to refactor it. Major Differences The compiler can detect many more issues in typed mode If your code isn't correct, you will get much better errors in typed mode Accessing invalid properties will throw an error in typed mode (eg. MyItem.String(\"InvalidProperty\") will throw, but Content.InvalidProperty will not) Typed code works much better with LINQ, so MyItem.Children(\"Authors\").Count() will just work (in dynamic mode you'd need to cast it to IEnumerable<dynamic> first) Activate Typed Mode Dynamic and Typed code can coexist in the same app. Each Razor / C# file can decide which mode it wants to use. To be in typed mode, your Razor/C# must inherit from a typed base class like this: Razor files should begin with: @inherits Custom.Hybrid.RazorTyped C# files should have something like: public class YourClassName : Custom.Hybrid.CodeTyped WebApi files should be like: public class YourControllerName : Custom.Hybrid.ApiTyped Tip Changing the base class will completely change the APIs you have available.

    "title": "Custom C# Web API Base Classes | 2sxc 16 / EAV 16",
    "keywords": "Custom C# Web API Base Classes Any WebAPI controller in ASP.net inherits from a base class. This is a typical code you may see as an example: [AllowAnonymous] public class BasicController : Custom.Hybrid.Api14 // <-- This is the Base Class { [HttpGet] public string Hello() { return \"Hello from the basic controller in /api\"; } } In these docs we want to explain what the base class is for, and what you should use. Why Inherit from a Base Class A WebAPI controller does a lot of magic in the background so your code can stay small and simple. In classic ASP.net you would inherit from a class called ApiController (namespace System.Web.Http). In classic Dnn you inherit from a base class DnnApiController (namespace DotNetNuke.Web.Api) which also inherits the ApiController. Tip Each additional layer adds functionality which will be available to your code. For example if you inherit from ApiController you can use objects such as Request and User in your code. If you inherit from DnnApiController your code can also use PortalSettings or ModuleInfo. Recommended Base Class in 2sxc 14+ You can use any base class available in 2sxc. But by inheriting the latest from Custom.Hybrid.Api14 docs your code will have access to many more objects like these: App Data Content CmsContext You also get many helper commands like these AsDynamic(...) AsEntity(...) AsList(...) SaveInAdam(...) Tip As of 2sxc 14 we always recommend that your APIs inherit from Custom.Hybrid.Api14 Avoid using SxcApiController and Others In previous versions of 2sxc the recommended base class was ToSic.SexyContent.WebApi.SxcApiController. For compatibility reasons this still works, but we strongly urge you to switch over to the new ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController as the old base class may become deprecated. Caution We strongly recommend that you switch over to the new base class Custom.Hybrid.Api14. But be aware that some of the APIs have changed a bit, so switching will take a few minutes. You will probably see compile errors which tell you what to fix. Why Hybrid Base Classes 2sxc v12 was made multi-platform to support both Dnn and Oqtane. By using any Custom.Hybrid.* base classes you can write code which will work on both platforms. Since we belive that moving between platforms will soon be important, it's best to start now.

The API is documented here and on this page we'll explain how to use it. How to use Here's a simple example, taken from mobius forms SaveInAdam(stream: dataStream, fileName: fileNameInForm, contentType: \"Advertisement\", guid: guid, field: \"Images\"); Here's what the parameters are: stream contains a stream of bytes with the file fileName contain the file name contentType is the content-type of the entity we're saving to guid is the entity-guid which receives this item field is the field we're saving to Example The following example is also from mobius forms and assumes that the html form encoded the data in JavaScript for sending to the WebApi: // Save files to Adam var files = ((Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JArray)contactFormRequest[\"Files\"]) .ToObject<IEnumerable<Dictionary<string, string>>>(); foreach(var file in files) { var data = Convert.FromBase64String((file[\"Encoded\"]).Split(',')[1]); SaveInAdam(stream: new MemoryStream(data), fileName: file[\"Name\"], contentType: type.Name, guid: guid, field: file[\"Field\"]); } Notes and Clarifications all parameters (stream, fileName, ...) must be named by convention the uploaded files are placed in the container of the field... ...and not added as a link to the file, so you will usually use library fields the field must be a field of type hyperlink, library or wysiwyg, other fields cannot receive files Difference in Field-Library and Field-Link-Default Note that the form has two different ways the field can behave. In hyperlink-Library mode nothing is really stored in the field name, the UI will simply load all the files in a folder that belong to that field. SaveInAdam will simply add files to this folder, so the most common way to use it is that the entity will have a link-library field to browse one or more files uploaded. If you really only want 1 file to be uploaded, and want to put it into the field as if it's linked directly, then choose a hyperlink-default field. SaveInAdam will give you a IFile object which has an Id. Use that to create a file:72 kind of link and add it to data you just created.

    "keywords": "Security & Permissions in Custom WebAPIs Important This page explains how security is configured in custom WebAPI controllers. But there is much more to security, so please read Security for 2sxc WebAPI and REST APIs as well. Custom WebAPI Security is configured using Attributes. These attributes can be placed on the class (in which case they apply to all actions/methods of that class) or on a specific method (in which case it only applies to that method). This example will NOT respond to Anonymous requests from outside: using System.Web.Http; public class BasicController : ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController { [HttpGet] public string Hello() { return \"Hello from the basic controller in /api\"; } } This example from the dnn web api tutorials will: using System.Web.Http; [AllowAnonymous] // define that all commands can be accessed without a login public class BasicController : ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController { [HttpGet] public string Hello() { return \"Hello from the basic controller in /api\"; } } And this example as well: using System.Web.Http; public class BasicController : ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController { [HttpGet] [AllowAnonymous] // only his command can be accessed without a login public string Hello() { return \"Hello from the basic controller in /api\"; } } Common Security Attributes for Custom WebAPI Controllers The exact set of attributes varies a bit on Dnn and Oqtane, but we're working on a unified set. As of now, these attributes are common in Dnn. You can apply all to both classes and methods: [AllowAnonymous] This allows non-identified users to use this endpoint. requires using System.Web.Http; [SupportedModules(\"2sxc,2sxc-app\")] This says to only respond to requests if they originate from a 2sxc module or a 2sxc-app Module. Note that this will only work if the Module Context is known. requires using DotNetNuke.Web.Api; [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] Verifies that the RequestVerificationToken in the header is valid. These requests will be blocked if the Anti-Forgery-Token is missing, invalid or is meant for another user. Note: this means such requests can only be called from a JS on a Dnn page requires DotNetNuke.Web.Api; [DnnModuleAuthorize(AccessLevel = SecurityAccessLevel.Admin)] In place of the SecurityAccessLevel.Admin you can also use SecurityAccessLevel.Anonymous or other values. Note that this will only work if the Module Context is known. requires using DotNetNuke.Web.Api; Common Other Attributes (HttpGet, HttpPost, HttpDelete) These attributes [HttpGet], [HttpPost] and [HttpDelete] are not really security attributes, but because they often lead to problems we figured we should mention them. Adding these to your method means that your method will listen to the Verbs mentioned, and only to these verbs. So a method like this: using System.Web.Http; public class BasicController : ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController { [HttpGet] [HttpDelete] public string Hello() { return \"Hello from the basic controller in /api\"; } } ...will only respond to GET and DELETE requests, but not to POST. Using Multiple Attributes You can use many attributes on the same class or method like this: [HttpGet] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] [SupportedModules(\"2sxc,2sxc-app\")] [DnnModuleAuthorize(AccessLevel = SecurityAccessLevel.Admin)] { return \"Hello from the basic controller in /api\"; } In most cases it will do exactly what you expect - and each condition must be met for the command to process. Common Mistakes Combining HttpGet with ValidateAntiForgeryToken Warning Combining [HttpGet] and [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] will fail, as GET requests cannot add custom headers. Deny Access at Class level and Allowing at Method Level Warning Class level attributes are handled first, and if these result in denying the request then method-level attributes won't be checked. Using Context-Requiring-Attributes for External Access Warning Certain tags like [DnnModuleAuthorize(...)] or [SupportedModules(...)] require a context. If you plan to use the API from outside of the site (like from a mobile app) then those requests will not have the context, and fail. Using ValidateAntiForgeryToken for External Access Warning Classes/methods decorated with [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] will require the token, which is only available for calls made by JavaScript on the page itself. If you plan to use the API from outside of the site (like from a mobile app) then those requests will fail.

For most of your apps this is not relevant 2sxc Philosophy - Stay out of the Way Our philosophy is to not reinvent the wheel so it's important that we let you use the .net APIs as they are designed. Se we don't plan on creating another API which to hide the differences, but let you understand them and easily handle everything as needed. Core Strategies for Hybrid WebAPIs If you follow these three rules you should be good to go: Inherit from Custom.Hybrid.Api12 Use very common C# features and syntaxes which existed since C# 7.2 (so anything that runs in Dnn will also run in Oqtane) Use .net standard 2.0 APIs and avoid using System.Web Where necessary, use preprocessor directives as explained below The Preprocessor Directives C# has special #if preprocessor statements which are evaluated during compilation. Using this you can define which code should be used in Dnn and Oqtane. Here's an example: // Add namespaces to enable security in Oqtane & Dnn despite the differences #if OQTANE using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization; // .net core [AllowAnonymous] & [Authorize] using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; // .net core [HttpGet] / [HttpPost] etc. using Oqtane.Shared; // Oqtane role names #else using System.Web.Http; // .net 4.5 [AllowAnonymous] / [HttpGet] using DotNetNuke.Web.Api; // [DnnModuleAuthorize] using DotNetNuke.Security; // SecurityAccessLevel.Xyz #endif // All commands can be accessed without security checks public class HybridController : ToSic.Custom.Api12 { [AllowAnonymous] // Works in Oqtane and Dnn [HttpGet] // Works in Oqtane and Dnn public string Hello() { return \"Hello from the basic controller in /api\"; } #if OQTANE [Authorize(Roles = RoleNames.Everyone)] #else [DnnModuleAuthorize(AccessLevel = SecurityAccessLevel.Anonymous)] #endif [HttpGet] public int Square(int number) { return number * number; } } The following symbols are set when Api Controllers are compiled: Key True for Dnn True for Oqtane Comments NETCOREAPP ⛔ ✅ Only works in WebAPIs and code (.cs) OQTANE ⛔ ✅ Only works in WebAPIs and code (.cs) Important: These don't work in Razor on Oqtane 3+ because we cannot activate these in the compiler - so they only work in .cs files Use like this: #if OQTANE ... #endif #if OQTANE ... #else ... #endif #if !OQTANE ... #endif #if !OQTANE ... #else ... #endif You can't use #if Dnn ... #endif because of limitations in the dynamic C# compiler of Dnn. Just use #if !OQTANE ... #endif. Different C# and .net Frameworks Part Dnn 7 Dnn 9 Oqtane C# Language ca. 7 ca. 7 C# 9 .net Framework 4.5.1 4.7.2 .net core 5 .net Standard 1.6 2.0 2.0 Any hybrid controller must limit itself to features in .net standard 1.6 or 2.0, depending on the platforms you want to support. Note that any 2sxc standard apps are meant to still run in Dnn 4.7.2, so we'll restrict our work to support .net standard 1.6. This means our examples are more limited than what you will be doing. Differences in the Platforms If you are creating hybrid controllers, we'll assume that you usually don't need to access properties of Dnn or Oqtane. If you do, you'll have to use the standard mechanisms provided by these. In Dnn - use global objects like PortalSettings.Current In Oqtane use Dependency Injection To avoid the code from causing trouble during compilation, wrap the necessary differences in #if OQTANE ... #endif and #if !OQTANE ... #endif blocks Security Attribute Differences All APIs need to have the correct attributes to mark the security requirements. // Oqtane way [Authorize(Roles = RoleNames.Admin)] // Dnn way [DnnModuleAuthorize(AccessLevel = SecurityAccessLevel.Admin)] The Attributes come from these namespaces: Dnn: DotNetNuke.Web.Api [DnnModuleAuthorize] - the most common security attribute [DnnAuthorize] - for special cases, we're not sure if it's ever used. my understanding is that it's for protecting an endpoint that will be accessed by users, but not from a module on the page, so the module-context would be missing. note that it's very different from the DnnModuleAuthorize [SupportedModules] - to limit access to an API from specific modules. You probabably won't ever use this. Oqtane: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization [Authorize] - standard Authorize of .net core The list of possible values come from these namespaces/enums/constants: Dnn: DotNetNuke.Security.SecurityAccessLevel Example: #todoc Oqtane Core Roles Oqtane.Shared.RoleNames Example: [Authorize(Roles = RoleNames.Host)] Multiple: [Authorize(Roles = RoleNames.Host, RoleNames.Admin)] Oqtane Common Permissions: Oqtane.Shared.PolicyNames Example: [Authorize(Policy = PolicyNames.ViewPage)] Multiple: [Authorize(Policy = PolicyNames.ViewPage, PolicyNames.ViewFolder)] Permissions of this using DnnModuleAuthorize or Authorize Target Permission DnnAuthorize DnnModuleAuthorize Oqtane Authorize System Admin ? SecurityAccessLevel.Host RoleNames.Host Site Admin ? SecurityAccessLevel.Admin RoleNames.Admin Registered users ? ? RoleNames.Registered Anybody ? Anonymous RoleNames.Everyone Module Editor ? SecurityAccessLevel.Edit PolicyNames.EditModule PolicyNames.EditPage Module Viewer ? SecurityAccessLevel.View PolicyNames.ViewModule PolicyNames.ViewPage Module Permissions Manager ? SecurityAccessLevel.ViewPermissions RoleNames.Admin Module ControlPanel ? SecurityAccessLevel.ControlPanel RoleNames.Admin Module SkinObjects ? ? SecurityAccessLevel.SkinObject RoleNames.Admin ValidateAntiForgeryToken Differences Comparison Purpose Attribute Dnn Namespace Oqtane/.net Core Namespace Enforce Anti-Forgery [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] DotNetNuke.Web.Api Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc Skip Enforcing on a method even if Class enforces it [IgnoreAntiforgeryToken] (doesn't exist) Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc Auto Enforce on unsafe calls (POST, etc.) [AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken] (doesn't exist) Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc Sidenote: in the .net core implementation the attributes can also accept an order parameter which defaults to 1000. We believe you should never change this :) but it does allow for other security configurations than were possible in Dnn. HTTP Verbs like GET, POST All APIs need to have attributes like [HttpGet] and [HttpPost]. The main difference you need to be aware of is that they must come from a different namespace. Use the #if ... statements as shown in the example above. API Result JSON Output Standard Implementations: In Dnn WebApis all data is automatically converted to JSON. This was an early design decision of 2sxc and works great for most cases, but some edge cases (like responding with XML) is more difficult this way. In Oqtane (.net core 5) the default is more sophisticated. The methods return objects or values. In advanced cases they will return an ActionResult or ContentResult. The default encoding is as follows: Simple values like strings are returned just as-is Complex objects are serialized - by default as json So for anything more complex the behavior is often identical, but for simple values it's different unless you specify explicitly what you want: Value Type Dnn 2sxc API Oqtane Apis Comments 27 int 27 27 identical \"Hello World\" string \"Hello World\" Hello World Note missing quotes in Oqtane which makes this non-json [\"a\", \"b\"] string[] [\"a\", \"b\"] [\"a\", \"b\"] identical The most important difference is that by default, strings are not converted to JSON If you need to return a simple string and must ensure it's JSON on both platforms, add this attribute to your class or method: [Produces(\"application/json\")] This is in the namespace using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc which you usually already have. Since Dnn won't know it, you will probably wrap it in an #if OQTANE like this: #if OQTANE [Produces(\"application/json\")] #endif History Introduced in 2sxc 12.00"

What these endpoints do is completely up to you. you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-process .process-web-api { visibility: visible; } Access Endpoints with JavaScript You can find a good example on live tutorials or in the Mobius Forms App. Calling these is as follows: .../app/auto/api/[YourName] when accessing a WebApi of the current app (from a dnn-page with this module), as then 2sxc uses auto-detect .../app/[app-folder]/api/[YourName] when using this endpoint from external, as auto-detect can't work then. Most WebApi Actions will require additional parameters. Just add them as url-parameters like ?param1=This&param2=That Discover More in the Web API Tutorials We have an rich series of Web API tutorials. You should really check them out 👍. Basic Example A file in your app in the api folder called BooksController.cs could look like the following: using DotNetNuke.Security; using DotNetNuke.Web.Api; using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Net.Http; using System.Web.Http; public class BooksController : ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController { [HttpGet] [DnnModuleAuthorize(AccessLevel = SecurityAccessLevel.Anonymous)] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public object Persons() { return new ToSic.Sxc.Conversion.DataToDictionary(Edit.Enabled) .Convert(App.Data[\"Persons\"]); } } The custom controller BooksController must have the same name as the file and extends the ApiController controller. It has a method returning all items of the Persons data type. The method is decorated with several attributes: [HttGet] defines that the method must be invoked with HTTP GET [DnnModuleAuthorize(AccessLevel = ...)] defines the permission an invoker must have [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] ensures that a security token from the cookies is validated before the mehod is invoked The custom controller can be called with JavaScript like this: @inherits Custom.Hybrid.Razor14 @{ // Tell the page that we need the 2sxc Js APIs Kit.Page.Activate(\"2sxc.JsCore\"); } <!-- the button which loads everything --> <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"getPersons(this)\"> Get Persons Custom </button> <script> // this script does the API call and then shows the result function getPersons(moduleContext) { $2sxc(moduleContext) .webApi.get('app/auto/api/books/persons') .then(function (results) { alert('Found ' + results.length + ' persons. \\n' + 'The first one is \"' + results[0].FirstName + ' ' + results[0].LastName + '\"\\n\\n' + 'The raw JSON: \\n' + JSON.stringify(results) ); }); } </script> The $2sxc API ensures that the GET request is send to the correct url /DesktopModules/2sxc/API/app/auto/api/Books/Persons. You can also read more about the sxc Controller. The Awesomeness of these API Controllers First and foremost, these API controllers let you run your code as you wish. But there's a lot more that make this the ideal choice for your code: Fast Development without ever Restarting 2sxc Web API Controllers are stored in your app as pure source code, and you can edit them at runtime. They will be compiled on the fly and don't require Dnn to restart. The built in source-code editor in 2sxc lets you make simple changes through your browser. And if you want more power then just open it in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. Simple Distribution and Tweaking 2sxc Apps can easily be exported and imported to other solutions. What's also typical is that new copies of the App may need some modifications to better suit the new needs. Since the C# files are included as source you can easily adapt the controllers to your needs. All 2sxc Objects Initialized Much of the productivity with 2sxc comes with the fact that so much is already done. When you create custom 2sxc Web APIs you automatically get everything like App and Data objects prepared for the context your code is running in. Notes Instead of App.Data[\"MyData\"] you can fetch data from another data source provided by 2sxc (for exmple from the App.Query[\"MyQueryData\"]) Sxc.Serializer.Prepare(...) converts the object returned by App.Data[\"MyData\"].List to a dynamic and serializable object Recommended Reading Web API Tutorials WebApi Concepts: Polymorphisms History Introduced in 2sxc 06.05 Enhanced with Polymorph Editions in 2sxc 9.35 (allowing subfolder/api)"

    "title": "Custom C# Web API - JSON Format | 2sxc 16 / EAV 16",
    "keywords": "Custom C# Web API - JSON Format Background: JSON Format in WebApi Requests Today most JavaScript clients use JSON to communicate with the server. This is a very simple format, which is easy to read and write. It's also very easy to parse in JavaScript, which is why it's so popular. In the old days, Microsoft used XML for this, but it's much more complex and difficult to read and write. When 2sxc was created, JSON was already the standard, so we never used XML. But at that time, the json plugin Newtonsoft was the de-facto standard, so we used that. But nowadays System.Text.Json is the de-facto standard. This means that by default this is what is being used: On DNN on all base classes up until Custom.Hybrid.Api14 Newtonsoft is used for serialization On Oqtane all base classes use the new .net core serializer How to Go Modern In 2sxc 16 we introduced a new attribute called [JsonFormatter] - see JsonFormatterAttribute. When it's applied to: a WebApi Controller class a specific method of that class then it will use the new .net core serializer. It has the following effects: It can auto-convert IEntity objects as well as lists/arrays of IEntity objects By default it will use camelCase for all properties, which is the modern standard. Tip Remember that this applies to both POST data from the client, as well as response data. Example using ToSic.Sxc.WebApi; // For the [JsonFormatter] (see below) [AllowAnonymous] [JsonFormatter] public class Api14AttController : Custom.Hybrid.Api14 { [HttpGet] public object GetEntity() { return (App.Data.List.First()); } [HttpGet] public object GetEntities() { return App.Data.List; } } Effects on the POST Data Tip POST data is parsed case-insensitive, so it doesn't matter if the client sends camelCase or PascalCase - it will be parsed correctly. There are 2 important effects to keep in mind: Most JSON in the POST will be the same no matter which serializer is used Only exotic data such as binary files will be different Effects on Response Data Tip Response data is usually read by JavaScript, which is case sensitive. The main impact on Response Data is the client should expect camelCase instead of PascalCase. This can be configured if you want it differently, like this: [HttpGet] [JsonFormatter(Casing = Casing.Preserve)] // auto-convert but preserve casing public dynamic PersonsAutoPreserveCasing() { return App.Data[\"Persons\"]; } It will also auto-convert Entities for you, which used to be very difficult.

Reading [root-path]/app/auto/data/BlogPost/1050 would give you exactly one BlogPost item (with the id 1050) Tip To figure out the exact path and the [root-path] part, best read about it in the admin-ui or work your way into the URLs for 2sxc WebAPI and REST APIs Create Data-Items/Entities Doing an http POST to this [root-path]/app/auto/data/BlogPost with a POST body of { \"Title\": \"changed title\"} would let you create the item.

So you can call HTTP GET to an endpoint like app/News/data/NewsItems/ and get a list of news items. You can also create / modify data using REST, access Queries and work with your custom Web-APIs - across all 2sxc platforms (Dnn / Oqtane / Custom) and with the security you need. Simple Example Here's an example JavaScript which would run in a 2sxc News-App on a Dnn page: // Get news as a promise var allNewsPromise = sxc.webApi.get('app/auto/data/News/'); // now log to console allNewsPromise.then(data => console.log(data)); This example has some magic happening in the background. Specifically 3 important things happen on the client before sending: The real URL which is requested is a bit longer, but the webApi takes care of that. The server needs to know what App and Module the script is calling from. This Context information is also added by the webApi. To add security, a crypto-token is added which will prove that the JavaScript requesting this is running on the page. This is also added by webApi. When the server receives the request, it too does important stuff. First it will use the URL and Context information to figure out what Site, Language and App should be accessed. The server will do some security checks to see if this request should be answered. Then it returns the data in a simple JSON format Get Started Step 1: Decide which Endpoint you need This checklist should help you decide: Getting Started Your 1-2-3 steps for using data endpoints are: Decide which endpoint you need Create / Publish the endpoint For standard endpoints, set the permissions as you need them For custom endpoints, write the C# code Write the code to read the data (typically in JavaScript) Conventions Used REST means that there is a url convention to access data like .../blogposts/25 REST also specifies that an HTTP GET is for reading, HTTP POST is for writing, etc. All the APIs use JSON for sending/receiving data.

So the information you find here is valid, but you probably don't need it URL Schema Specifications (Advanced) One of the most confusing aspects when using the REST API or custom WebApis is finding the right URL to talk to the API. Read this to help you understand what's going on and get started quickly. Every 2sxc REST URL is built with the following parts: [root]/app/[app-identity]/[app-part]/[specifics] The root is determined by Dnn and changes a bit by Dnn version, portal, and language configuration. more The app-identity says what app we're addressing. It's often auto for auto-detection, but when auto-detection isn't available, it's the app-folder name. more the app-part determines if we're accessing data, query or api of the app. The specifics is a path part describing what exactly what we're accessing and varies depending on the API. Part 1: The Root Path The Root in Dnn 9+ In Dnn 9 the root was shortened to: [portal-root-with-language]/api/2sxc/... Note The old root from Dnn 7 and 8 still work in Dnn 9 for compatibility. The Root in Dnn 7 and 8 Dnn 7 & 8: [portal-root-with-language]/desktopmodules/2sxc/api/... Warning An easy thing to overlook is that in Dnn 7 and 8 it was 2sxc/api but in Dnn 9 it's api/2sxc The Root in Oqtane This is still WIP, but most likely it's [domain]/[site-id-number]/api/2sxc/... Part 2: The App-Identity When to use or not-use Auto-Detection auto The App-identity can be either the word auto to use auto-detection, or the app-folder-name if you can't use auto-detection. Tip Whenever you're working in Dnn and accessing the endpoint from a module that contains the same App, then you should use auto-detection. Warning Auto-Detection relies on Dnn mechanisms to detect the Context (usually sending the PageId and ModuleId in HTTP-headers). 2sxc uses these headers to figure out what App you're using. If something fails in auto-detection, you're probably not using the normal Dnn conventions for making REST calls. Warning When calling an endpoint from another website or a mobile App, you cannot use auto but must specify the app-folder name. Or you can provide Context by adding ?PageId=...&ModuleId=... to the url. Tip If you're not using auto-detection, then the root path must be absolutely correct. Here's why: If you have multiple portals then each portal could have other apps, or sometimes even the same app (like a Blog app). In this case, the root-path says what portal is being used, which in turn is important to get the correct app. App-Identity Examples To access an API (in this example the data) from JS code in the same app you can rely on auto-detection of the app, like this: .../app/auto/data/... To access the same Glossary-App from elsewhere, like from the skin (for example, to highlight all words to which your glossary-app has definitions), from another app, or from another website, you would specify the folder name as auto-detection won't work. Like this: .../app/Glossary/data/... This applies to all endpoints like data, query, api. Part 3: App-Part Data, Query or Web-Api Part 3a: App-Part Data Tip Starting with 2sxc v13, the data-api is .../app/.../data/TYPENAME. In previous versions, it's .../app/.../content/TYPENAME. If your part is data then you're using the normal content/entity REST API. It supports all common HTTP verbs. In this case you have the following possibilities after data/: .../data/[YourContentType] HTTP GET will retrieve all items of this type .../data/[your-content-type]/[item-id] where item-id is the number or the GUID HTTP GET will get one item HTTP POST is used to create an item or update it HTTP DELETE will delete the item Warning This requires that permissions are configured to allow it. The permissions are very powerful so make sure you understand them. Tip You can also configure permissions in ways that allow users to only create draft items (which would then require an admin to publish it) Data Example Assume you have the blog-app installed and your JS would request a JSON from this endpoint (logged in as host, so security is not an issue): [root-path]/app/auto/data/BlogPost ...then your JS would receive a JSON with all BlogPost items. More examples: Reading [root-path]/app/auto/data/BlogPost/1050 would give you exactly one BlogPost item (with the id 1050) HTTP POST to [root-path]/app/auto/data/BlogPost/1050 with a POST body of { \"Title\": \"changed title\"} would let you update the item 1050. Part 3b: App-Part Query The Query endpoint can be accessed on .../query/[your-query-name]. Note that Query endpoints only support the HTTP-verb GET, since it's read-only. Warning This requires that permissions are configured to allow it. The permissions are very powerful so make sure you understand them. Tip Make sure you give your queries simple names without spaces if you intend to use them in REST calls. Tip Queries can also expect url-parameters if they are configured to do this. So if you query has an ID-filter which expects a token [QueryString:id] you can also call your query like .../app/auto/query/GetWithId?id=27 Query Example Assume you have the blog-app installed and your JS would request a JSON from this endpoint (logged in as host, so security is not an issue): [root-path]/app/auto/query/BlogPostsByAuthor?Author=Daniel%20Mettler This would run the pre-defined query and return the Blog Posts of the author Daniel Mettler. Part 3c: App-Part Custom C# Web Api Custom WebAPI use one of these schemas .../api/[controller-name]/[action-or-more-params] .../[edition]/api/[controller-name]/[action-or-more-params] Your C# code determines what HTTP-verbs will work (GET, POST, etc.). Your code is also responsible for determining what permissions are used, like Anonymous etc. The [edition] is relevant if you're using Polymorphism. So if you don't specify an edition, the controller is expected to be in the [AppFolder]\\api but if you do use polymorphism the controller must be in [AppFolder]\\[edition]\\api.

Tip The Context contains default information about the request incl. the site/app it's for, what languages to use etc. In most cases the client will include the necessary information automatically. The following section is helpful if... ...you need to manually include the context, like when you're request originates from outside of the ecosystem ...you need to override some context information, like when your JS is on a German site but want to get the English data In these docs we explain what each part of the context does, where it's from, what it's for and how to optionally override it. 1. The Site / Portal Context (required) Since our platforms (Dnn/Oqtane) could have multiple sites in the same installation, the first thing that must be determined is what site this request is for. How the Site is Automatically Detected In Dnn a site is always identified by the root path to the site, as it's configured in Dnn. Examples: https://www.2sxc.org is site 0 https://2sic.org is site 0 https://2sxc.org/en is site 0 https://2sxc.org/de is site 0 https://2sxc.org/dnn-tutorials/ is site 24 In Oqtane a site is always identified through a number in the route (the domain is ignored). Examples: .../1/api/... is site 1 .../2/api/... is site 2 What is Affected by the Site Context The Site context is important for various additional pieces of context: The languages available (can be different on each site) The primary language (configured per site) The current language (can only be one of the available languages or primary) The app (see below, apps are installed on sites) Providing an Own Value or Overriding the Default Just call the other endpoint with the correct URL. 2. Current Language The current language is necessary for read operations to determine what values to actually use. In case of a no-language or single-language site it's not important. How the Current Language is Automatically Detected In Dnn the current language is part of the url, as configured in the site, so it's dependent on the Site Context. Here some examples: 2sxc.org/en would be configured to be en-US 2sxc.org/de would be configured to be de-DE de.2sxc.org would be configured to be de-DE In Oqtane the convention isn't clear yet (WIP) What is Affected by the Current Language All read operations in the API and internally will try to access values meant for that language. Return values will also prefer that language (if translations exist). Providing an Own Value or Overriding the Current Language The most common way to use another language is to use the appropriate url which matches that language. Another way to do it is to include a parameter in the request like ?language=en. Warning Setting the ?language=xxx parameter in Dnn has a suprising performance penalty of ca. 200-300ms. So if you can, prefer to just use the correct initial path. 3. Page and Module Context (optional) Whenever the API call is used on a Dnn or Oqtane page, the HTTP call will usually include this information in the request to assist in auto-detecting the App Context. How the Page and Module are Automatically Detected The standard implementation is that API-Calls include special HTTP headers with these IDs. These headers are used: PageId (number) ModuleId (number) Note For historical reasons, Dnn includes a TabId which contains the same value as PageId. The backend will treat these as the same header. We changed this to PageId in v11 and for future stability please use PageId. What is Affected by the Page and Module Context The primary use for the Page/Module Context is figuring out what App Context to use. So if the Module 2472 on Page 51 on Portal 7 is a Blog App then, then the App Context will be this Blog App. The second use is providing data for this Module Instance. So if a module has content or data assigned to it (like a Category List showing 3 selected Categories), then this data will be available automatically. The third important use is for permission detection: if the current user has certain permissions on this page/module, then these permissions also apply to the current API request. If the Page/Module context is missing, then only default permissions apply. The final and obvious use is that certain backend APIs will know these values, so that objects like CmsContext.Page.Id have these values for the scripts to use. See also ICmsContext Providing an Own Value or Overriding the Default Page/Module The default calls on the 2sxc JS API including dnn-sxc-angular will automatically set these headers if it can. If you have a reason to include alternate values, just make sure that you change the headers either by modifying the request before it's sent, or by using another http-caller like jQuery. 4. App Context (required) All WebAPI operations happen inside an App. They are either Content/Query REST calls (so they apply to the app) or custom WebApis (which are in the app-folder) - so the App must always be known. How the App Context is Automatically Detected The App Context requires that the Site Context is already known. Then there are two ways for the App Context to be detected: If the Page Context and Module Context are known, then this automatically leads to the app to be used, as it's the app on that module. Note: In rare cases the page and module are set, but the app has not been selected yet. This edge case only affects internal APIs of 2sxc, not the normal use we discuss here If Page/Module are not known or not provided, then the app is chosen based on the App-Name in the url. This is the default mechanism used when calling endpoints from other pages or mobile apps. If both the Page/Module Context and the App-Name are provided, then the App-Name is prioritized. If it is about the same App, then the full context (with Page/Module) is used, allowing more permissions to work. If neither Page/Module nor App Context are known, then the request will fail. What is Affected by the App Context The App Context will be used for almost everything, including these aspects: The data and configuration used (App.Data etc.) The path to code (like custom WebApi Controllers) Permissions on the App or Content-Types Providing an Own Value or Overriding the Default App Context To access another app you will usually supply another App-Name in the url for the API-Call. In rare cases you may also provide other Page and Module Context headers, but this is usually not a good idea. 5. Current User (required) All operations happen in the context of a user, either Anonymous or the Current User Identity. How the Current User is Automatically Detected The current user is always provided by the environment (Dnn or Oqtane). If no user is identified, the platform always tells 2sxc that the user is Anonymous. What is Affected by the Current User Read / Write permissions (either directly or indirectly if a user is in a group with permissions) Read-Draft permissions (admins may also see data which isn't published yet) Identity used when saving data Providing an Own Value or Overriding the Default App Context The user is fixed to being the real user logged in (or Anonymous). So if you need to execute something in another identity, make sure your system logs into Dnn/Oqtane using the built-in mechanisms (like JWT) and then perform the request using that authentication. 6. Other: Edition (optional) This only applies to custom WebAPI controllers. Custom WebAPI controllers are usually stored in the folder [App-Root]/api. You can also place them in subfolders like [App-Root]/live/api in which case live would be an edition. This allows you to have multiple editions of the same controller for staging, testing and more. As it's not really context information, it's only mentioned here. To find out more, read about the URL Schema and about Polymorphisms. 6. Other: RequestVerificationToken (maybe optional) Dnn and Oqtane have a security system to ensure that requests are coming from the page itself and that they are using the right login. This is not really context, so the full mechanism is explained in [Security][xref:WebApi.Specs.Security].

    "keywords": "Security for 2sxc WebAPI and REST APIs you are here (click to zoom) - discover the stack .context-box-summary .browser-interact, .context-box-summary .process-apis { visibility: visible; } All WebAPI calls in Dnn, Oqtane and 2sxc have some security features. In the basic use cases it's straightforward: the current user may do some things, and that should be allowed. These docs should help you understand where these things are configured and what to change if you need adjustments. Request Security Each request contains information needed for the backend to determine if this request should be answered or not. In Dnn and Oqtane this is the User Identity and the RequestVerificationToken. User Identity By default, the user is logged in using normal web conventions and from then on the user will have an encrypted cookie identifying this person. In advanced scenarios you may also use JWT aka Json Web Tokens. This is useful in mobile app scenarios and scenarios where the client application is remote (like a web-server or a SPA). Consult the docs of Dnn or Oqtane to find out how to use this. You could also use custom login systems like OAuth, but in these cases you will really need to figure out how to implement it in Dnn or Oqtane. Anti Forgery Token: RequestVerificationToken ASP.net has a feature to prevent XSS (Cross Site Scripting / Cross-Site Request Forgery). To make this possible, pages viewed by a user have some hidden key included which is encrypted to include identity-information for this user. It is included in all HTTP requests except for GET requests. If an endpoint is secured to check for this using [ValidateAntiForgeryToken], then only requests containing this header will be processed. Tip Not all endpoints require this, but many do. It's commonly enforced on admin-endpoints and on any endpoint which are not expected to be used from outside of the site. It's best practice to require this where possible. Warning GET requests don't include this header, so don't enforce checking this in the backend for GET endpoints. When you use standard 2sxc JS WebAPI calls, the RequestVerificationToken is automatically included in the request. If you use your own JS API stack or plain vanilla browser implementations, make sure you add it. REST Content and Query Endpoint Security The built-in Content and Query endpoints use configuration based security. Prerequisites: Platform Permissions are OK Just to be aware of the obvious: if the platform (Dnn/Oqtane) don't allow access to the endpoints for whatever reason, then even the built-in endpoints won't do anything. Default Security Configuration: Nothing is allowed Both Content and Query are by default only available to admins and super-users. To make these available to other users (incl. Anonymous) this must be configured. Opening Security Configuration These are the places you can configure to open security: On an App you can give general permissions that apply to all content types. This is usually not recommended. On a Query you can configure read permissions for specific users or user groups. On a Content-Type (the schema that says what fields exist) you can configure many permissions incl. read and write. You can even configure more exotic permissions like: Anonymous users can create data, but they are set to draft and not visible Registered users can create data and only edit data which they created Note Permissions are all locked by default, and adding permissions will only open up permissions. There are no deny-permissions. Warning Some permissions like If the user has View permissions, allow Read require a Module Context since that's required to detect if the condition View Permissions is met.
