# 2sxc JS API Documentation is WIP

_We're reorganizing our JS API Docs - they will be moved to here. This is still Work-In-Progress._

# JavaScript and TypeScript Code

[!include[](~/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .browser-all { visibility: visible; } </style>

Many people implement JavaScript or TypeScript solutions using 2sxc, as it's ideal both for simple scripts like galleries as well as for bundling and distributing complex Angular or React SPAs.

Note: We're just consolidating docs in this section, so it's still very incomplete. 

What it should contain in the end is...

1. Guidance for using the basic $2sxc and sxc for working with data/apis - with npm packages etc.
1. Guidance for using the edit API
1. Guidance for customizing toolbars?
1. Guidance for Angular integration
1. Guidance for React integration


Basic Structure probably

* JS Framework Overview

* JS Basics

* Inpage CMS API

* Angular SPAs

* Edit UI API
