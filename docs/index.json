    "keywords": "All DataSource Objects in 2sxc / EAV 2sxc provides a large set of DataSource objects which either get data from somewhere (SQL, CSV, ...) or modify data on the In and passing it to Out . This page will give you an overview and link you to further sources if you need to know more. How to use Many data-sources are simply used in the Visual Query , and if all you want is visual-query, then this reference will give you an overview regarding what things are possible. It will usually look like this: If on the other hand you want to program with these DataSource objects, then it will usually look a bit like this: An example code // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = CreateSource<EntityTypeFilter>(); allAuthors.TypeName = \"Author\"; // Sort by FullName var sortedAuthors = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthors.Attributes = \"FullName\"; The previous example creates an initial source allAuthors which has all data on the in, then filters to only provide those of type Author to the out. This is then piped to the sortedAuthors , which sorts on the Attributes field. Understanding Data-Flow and Configuration This is explained in the DataSource documentation . All Public DataSources These are all the data sources which are either provided in the default installation of 2sxc, or which are available for you to install (manually). Data Source Purpose Description & Details App Organize Provides each content-type on the out-stream (...) Provides each content-type on the out-stream, so that you can use ds[\"any-type-name\"] as if there was a table for each type. AttributeFilter Modify Removes properties on the entities (...) Removes properties on the entities, typically before you stream it to JSON, so that only the fields you want are transmitted. AttributeRename Modify Renames properties on the entities... Renames properties on the entities and optionally removes the remaining ones. BaseCache (internal) Base class (...) The base class for all system caches (QuickCache, FarmCache, etc.) BaseDataSource (internal) Base class (...) This is just a base class. CacheAllStreams Caching Cache all streams passing through (...) Every stream on this \"In\" are also available on the \"Out\" but cached a certain amount of time or till the upstream source is invalidated. ContentTypeFilter EntityTypeFilter Filter Only items of a specific content-type (...) Returns only items which are of a certain content-type. Note: was previously called EntityTypeFilter. CsvDataSource Get Data Get data from a CSV-file (...) Lets you read a CSV file and provide the data as Entities for further use. not well documented yet, see code here DataTable DataSource Get Data Base class for coding only (...) Lets you convert a .net DataTable object into a DataSource. This is great for when you find it easier to generate a DataTable, and this will auto-provide it as a stream. Deferred Pipeline Query (internal) Internal object to optimize performance (...) This is used internally, because it will auto-generate an entire query-pipeline from configuration and query it, but only if accessed. ToSic.Eav.DataSources.DeferredPipelineQuery Deferred Pipeline Query code Dnn FormAndList Get Data Use old FnL data in 2sxc (...) Will let you access Form-And-List aka UDT (Universal Data Table) data. ToSic.SexyContent.Environment.Dnn7. DataSources.DnnFormAndList Dnn FormAndList code DnnSql DataSource Get Data DNN Sql DataSource (...) Sql which only uses the DNN DB and nothing else, based on the Sql DataSource DnnUserProfile DataSource Get Data Get DNN Users and profiles (...) Get DNN users and profiles to create user directories, details-pages etc. ToSic.SexyContent.Environment.Dnn7. not well documented, check out the source code here DataSources.DnnUserProfileDataSource ExternalData DataSource (internal) Base Class for external data DataSources (...) This is a base-class for all kinds of external data sources (like Csv…) because it provides more information related to enabling cachning etc. ToSic.Eav.DataSources.ExternalDataDataSource ExternalData DataSource code ItemIdFilter EntityIdFilter Filter One or more items with an Id (...) Return only 0, 1 or more items which fit the IDs in the string provided. Previously named EntityIdFilter ItemFilterDuplicates Logic Find and remove OR retrieve duplicate items (...) Use this to remove duplicates or just find them (or both) Module-Instance DataSource Get Data Get current modules data (...) Will get the content-items assigned to a DNN-Module. This is used internally on each view, but can also be used when using module-data to configure a query. OwnerFilter Filter Only items which are \"owned\" by a user (...) Returns only items which are \"owned\" = created by a specific person. Great for tools where the users have their own data / registrations which they can still modify. Paging Logic Page through items (...) Returns only a specific amount of items after skiping another amount; also provides a stream telling you how many items / pages are in the stream, to let you assemble a pager UI element PassThrough (internal) Do-Nothing DataSource (...) This data source doesn't actually do anything - it just lets the data on the in to the out. For (internal) and testing stuff. PublishingFilter Filter Filters items the current user shouldn't see (...) This is part of the \"Unpublished-Data\" concept. Since each item could be either published or draft, this helps you show the correct ones for the current user based on his edit-rights. It's automatically in the default pipeline, unless you explicitly don't want it. QuickCache (internal) Internal cache class (...) The quick and simple cache used by default internally. ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Caches.QuickCache QuickCache code RelationshipFilter Filter Filter items which have a relationship (...) This helps you find items which are related to another item - like \"All Books by Author Daniel Mettler\" New in 8.12: In-Stream \"Fallback\" which is returned if the filter didn't return any hits. Sql Get Data Get SQL data as entities (...) This lets you get data from any SQL data base. It also has powerful script-injection protection, so messy parameters won't hurt it. Shuffle Logic Shuffle/randomize item order (...) This source mixes up the order of the items, typically for things like \"show 3 random quotes\" StreamFallback Logic Returns the first in-stream with results (...) Use this to choose from multiple in-streams which data to show. It will use all the in-streams sorted A-Z, and return the first stream which can deliver data. The remaining streams will not be queried. StreamMerge Logic Merge all in-stream into 1 (...) Use this to merge multiple in-streams into one output stream. StreamPick Logic Pick a stream (...) Use this to pick one of multiple in-streams by name. Often used together with the token [Params:ShowDrafts] ValueFilter Filter Filters by value (...) Returns all items where a specified property matches the filter. Very powerfull, with filters like contains, between, etc. New in 8.12: In-Stream \"Fallback\" which is returned if the filter didn't return any hits. ValueSort Sort Sorts all items (...) Sorts the items in the stream asc/desc based on a property. ViewDataSource (internal) Internal class for view-handling (...) This is technically just the target of a pipeline, which is then routed to the Razor/Token View. Basically just does a full pass-through.

    "href": "specs/datasources/query-params.html",
    "title": "Query Parameters / Tokens | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Query Parameters / Tokens Queries can be parameterized with token placeholders like [QueryString:Id] , [App:Settings:PageSize] or [Params:Sort] (new in v10.22) . To understand these placeholder tokens, best read up on DataSource Concept: Configuration Injection using Tokens and Placeholder Tokens . There you'll read about how tokens work, where they come from, how to use default/fallback values and more. This page explains how Queries have four special types of parameters, namely these: Special LookUp: [Params:...] (new in v10.22) Special LookUp: [In:...] Option to override the values during testing with TestParameters Params LookUp (new in 10.22) The query now has a special LookUp for the source Params . This should help you make nicer, more flexible queries and also allow you to set these query parameters from C# code. Tip You can set these params in the Query configuration dialog TODO: PIC Note Your queries can also use params that you didn't configure - but they will return nothing unless you would set them in your C# code before you run the query. Tip We recommend to always use the Params for everything as it's simpler to see all the parameters your query depends on. So if you have a ValueFilter expecting a value from the url, we recommend that you Create a param FilterLastName=[QueryString:LastName] In your data-source configuration, use [Params:FilterLastName] In LookUp Data Sources in a query can also retrieve values from another data-source which is a source. Use the [In:source-name:attribute-name] syntax. So if you have a Value DataSource which has the Default -in with the data to filter, and a Module -in comes from the Module Settings, you would write [In:Module:Category] to filter by the the category as selected in the module settings. Testing your Query with Test Parameters The VisualQuery Designer also allows you to set test-values for testing the query. The test-values should define all the full tokens to replace. Example: [QueryString:Id]=27 [QueryString:SortOrder]=Desc [Params:FilterLastName]=Mettler [Params:FilterNameSort]=[QueryString:SortOrder||Asc] Tip As you can see in the example, even test params can contain more tokens if you need them. In the above example, Params:FilterNameSort would resolve to Desc because it will first check the QueryString:SortOrder which also has a test-value of Desc . Setting Query Parameters in your Code In a Razor or WebApi file, you can always write something like this var allPosts = App.Query[\"AllBlogPosts\"]; allPosts.Params(\"Category\", \"Web\"); var posts = allPosts[\"Default\"]; var dynPosts = AsList(posts); Warning Query objects are single use - which is an internal optimization for reliable, rapid access. So if you retrieve various streams, the query still only executes once. But if you set a parameter after running the query, you will get an error, unless you call Reset() first. See the next example: var query = App.Query[\"AllBlogPosts\"]; query.Params(\"Category\", \"Web\"); var webPosts = AsList(query); // this would result in an error // allPosts.Params(\"Category\", \"IT\"); // this works query.Reset(); query.Params(\"Category\", \"IT\"); var itPosts = AsList(query); Read also VisualQuery Designer APIs Query QueryDefinition QueryPartDefinition Blog Posts about Visual Query Designer History Introduced in 2sxc 07.00 In added in 2sxc 07.00 Params added in 2sxc 10.22"

    "keywords": "Query Basics Queries are special Data-Sources which internally chain various other Data-Sources to query the underlying data. They can be built in two ways: Directly in your code Built from a configuration which is itself stored as a set of entities Such queries are then used to give data to a view, to a JavaScript SPA (throug a simple REST API) or to your code, which can then perform other operations with the data. How to use Usually you'll configure queries in the VisualQuery Designer in the App settings. Here's a Getting Started with Visual Query . There are a lot of Blogs about Visual Query Designer that will help you start. Then you will usually configure a view to use this. Using Queries in your Code In a Razor or WebApi file, you can always write something like this var query = App.Query[\"AllBlogPosts\"]; var posts = query[\"Default\"]; // you could now work with the data, or you could cast all results into dynamic objects, like... var categories = AsList(query[\"Categories\"]); // if all you need is the \"Default\" stream as dynamic, you can write var posts = AsList(query); Now you can loop through the data as you would otherwise, for example: <ol> @foreach(var person in AsList(query[\"Persons\"])) { <li>@person.FullName</li> } </ol> Technical Implementation The data which defines a query is stored as IEntity data. So there is a header IEntity which is read through an QueryDefinition . It contains the name, and a bunch of metadata IEntity items which are read as QueryPartDefinition . It also contains a list of Connections which define how the DataSources pass data from one source to another. There are also test-parameters on such a query, which are only used for testing in the VisualQuery Designer Read also Query Parameters / Tokens Blog Posts about Visual Query Designer DataSources History Introduced in 2sxc 07.00"

    "keywords": "Namespace ToSic.Eav.Data The EAV Data system underlying 2sxc is the core data management system, in charge of Entities and such. For long term stability, we only use interfaces in the API. To better understand this stuff, best read about the Data Models in the EAV . In most cases you only care about the IEntity interface and things below that. Classes Attribute<T> Represents an Attribute / Property of an Entity with Values of a Generic Type AttributeBase Represents an Attribute Definition. Used in Content-Types and IEntities. ContentType Represents a ContentType ContentTypeAttribute Defines an attribute with name and the type this attribute has. Part of of a IContentType definition. ContentTypeMetadata Provides metadata for a content type. This can be very special, because ContentTypes can be shared (ghosts), in which case the metadata must be retrieved from another \"remote\" location (where the original is defined). DimensionDefinition The definition of a dimension / language Entity A basic unit / item of data. Has many IAttribute<T> s which then contains IValue<T> s which are multi-language. EntityBasedType Foundation for a class which gets its data from an Entity. This is used for more type safety - because some internal objects need entities for data-storage, but when programming they should use typed objects to not accidentally access invalid properties. EntityBasedWithLog A strongly typed object which gets its data from an entity, and also logs what it does. EntityLight Represents a light Entity, which is a very basic entity without multi-language capabilities, versions or publishing. For the more powerful Entity, use IEntity . EntityRelationship Represents a Relation between two entities, connecting a parent to a child. Language Represents a Dimension / Language Assignment LazyEntities Delivers entities which are needed. It's lazy, because on initialization it only knows the Ids (int/guid) of the items to pick up, and only retrieves them when needed. Once retrieved, it will cache the result, until the up-stream reports changes. An additional optimization: in special cases where we just need the IDs for saving, it won't actually query the cache if the IDs are already known. Value<T> Represents a typed Value object in the memory model Interfaces IAttribute Represents an Attribute with Values - without knowing what data type is in the value. Usually we'll extend this and use IAttribute<T> instead. IAttribute<T> Represents an Attribute (Property), but strongly typed IAttributeBase Represents properties we should know about Attributes. This is the base for both IContentTypeAttribute (in the IContentType) attribute with values-list (in the IEntity) IContentType Represents a Content Type information (the schema) used for IEntity objects. IContentTypeAttribute Represents an Attribute definition in a ContentType. This is the base for attributes in IContentType IDimension Represents a Dimension to assign values to. Dimensions are usually languages ( ILanguage ), but in future they could also be multi-dimensional, like values which are mapped to a language and to a specific edition, use case, etc. IEntitiesSource This marks something which can give a list of entities. Usually used for lazy-loading data, where the source is attached, but the data isn't loaded yet. IEntity The primary data-item in the system, IEntity is a generic data-item for any kind of information. Note that it inherits IEntityLight which is the basic definition without languages, versioning, publishing etc. We recommend you read about the Data Models in the EAV IEntityBasedType Foundation for interfaces which will enhance EntityBasedType which gets its data from an Entity. This is used for more type safety - so you base your interfaces - like IPerson on this, otherwise you're IPerson would be missing the Title, Id, Guid IEntityLight Represents a light Entity, which is a very basic entity without multi-language capabilities, versions or publishing. For the more powerful Entity, use IEntity . ILanguage Represents a Language Dimension. It's identical to an IDimension for now. IRelationshipManager Manages relationships of an entity - to it's children and parents. IValue Represents a Value in the EAV system. Values belong to an attribute and can belong to multiple languages. IValue<T> Represents a Value with a specific type (string, decimal, etc.). IWrapper<T> This is for any object which does something, but caries with it an original object which is the type of the hosting system (environment) Enums ValueTypes Attribute Type Enum"

Now you can configure what properties you want and not. The following shows a demo which delivers both the data as-is, and also filtered to only deliver Name and Country : This is what you get on the default-case (unfiltered): \"Default\": [ { \"Name\": \"2sic\", \"Country\": \"Switzerland\", \"Notes\": \"<p>Secret notes</p>\", \"Categories\": [ { \"Id\": 38646, \"Title\": \"Second\" } ], \"Id\": 38653, \"Guid\": \"46a46d9e-f572-413c-a42e-a82ac40d929d\", \"Title\": \"2sic\", \"Modified\": \"2017-11-06T22:38:00.15Z\" }, ... ] This is what you get on the filtered stream: \"Cleaned\": [ { \"Name\": \"2sic\", \"Country\": \"Switzerland\", \"Id\": 38653, \"Guid\": \"46a46d9e-f572-413c-a42e-a82ac40d929d\", \"Title\": \"2sic\", \"Modified\": \"2017-11-06T22:38:00.15Z\" }, ... ] As you can see, the secret Notes and the Categories are not in the Cleaned stream any more.

    "keywords": "Namespace ToSic.Eav.DataSources DataSources are objects which deliver one or many DataStreams , which contain a bunch of content-items. They are then attached to each other (from one sources Out to another ones In ) creating a Query . Queries can be customized at will. The whole system is used to prepare/process data for views, WebApi or anything else. In most cases there will be a VisualQuery which connects all the parts automatically, but when you want to work with them programatically, here you'll find the API. Note We've hidden the constructors for all DataSource objects in these docs, because you should usually use the CreateSource<T>(...) command on the Razor template or WebApi, which will auto-configure things behind the scenes. Tip Read about DataSources here . It also explains how the configuration system works and how to create custom DataSources to deliver your data to EAV/2sxc. Classes App All the data inside an App. For example, it has a variable amount of Out-streams, one for each content-type in the app. AppRoot The App Root is the entry point for all data. It takes it's data from a hidden AppState Cache. It's implemented as a DataSource so that other DataSources can easily attach to it. This is also the object returned as the root in any query. AttributeFilter DataSource to only pass through configured AttributeNames - other attributes/properties are removed from the entities. AttributeRename DataSource to only pass through configured AttributeNames - other attributes/properties are removed from the entities. CsvDataSource DataSource for importing/reading CSV files. DataSourceBase The base class, which should always be inherited. Already implements things like Get One / Get many, Caching and a lot more. DataTable Provide Entities from a System.Data.DataTable. This is not meant for VisualQuery, but for code which pre-processes data in a DataTable and then wants to provide it as entities. EntityIdFilter A DataSource that filters Entities by Ids EntityTypeFilter Return only entities of a specific content-type ExternalData Base DataSource class for providing data from external systems ItemFilterDuplicates A DataSource that merges two streams OwnerFilter Filter entities to show Drafts or only Published Entities Paging A DataSource that filters Entities by Ids PassThrough A DataSource that passes through all In Connections. Can be used con consolidate/merge multiple Sources into one. PublishingFilter Filter entities to show Drafts or only Published Entities QueryRun Run another query and provide the resulting data. The settings will provide the params for the query. RelationshipFilter Filter Entities by Value in a Related Entity. For example: Find all Books (desired Entity), whose Authors (related Entity) have a Country (Attribute) with 'Switzerland' (Value). Shuffle A DataSource that filters Entities by Ids Sql Provide Entities from a SQL Server StreamFallback A DataSource that returns the first stream which has content StreamMerge A DataSource that merges two streams StreamPick A DataSource that returns a stream by the provided name. Usually this will be configured through [Params:SomeName] ValueFilter Return only Entities having a specific value in an Attribute ValueSort Sort Entity by values in specified Attributes Interfaces IAppRoot Interface for the App Root - usually the very first node in any data-delivery or query. It's just like a normal IDataSource but will internally access the AppState from the IAppsCache . IDataSource Public interface for an Eav DataSource. All DataSource objects are based on this. IDataStream Represents a DataStream object. This is a stream of IEntity objects, which has a source and a name. A stream can be read from, and it can be attached to upstream data-sources for further processing. IDataTarget Represents a data source that can be the recipient of Data. This basically means it has an In IDataStream"

If such a group exists, then only users in that group (and all host-users) see the advanced button, any other user will not see advanced buttons any more. You can find more instructions in this 2sxc Designers checklist . Custom Toolbars You can create any kind of toolbar, and you can decide to show/hide which ever you want based on security roles in DNN. This requires standard C# / Razor skills and is not explained more in detail right now.

Since then it has found many new applications. JSON Package The Json format has a minimal header like this: { \"_\": { \"V\": 1 } } which just contains the version. Future non-breaking enhancements will leave the version on 1 and optionally add more header information. In addition to that, the basic package can contain either a ContentType node see specs or an Entity node see specs This could then look like this: { \"_\": { \"V\": 1 }, \"ContentType\": { \"Id\": \"|Config ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SqlDataSource\", \"Name\": \"|Config ToSic.Eav.DataSources.SqlDataSource\", ... } } Special Stuff about the JSON Format All values have language information As we're usually working with real-life content-items, multi-language is always a concern. Because of this, every value is multi-language by default. If the language code is *, that means that this value is the default/fallback value for all languages. Metadata is a Recursive List of Entities 2sxc and the EAV is all about real-life content-management. As such, many pieces of information have more information attached, called Metadata.

This is mostly historic, as all new content-types will have GUIDs, but old types still exist in the system which have a nice name, but that's not ideal for various use cases. Scope is Like a Virtual Group The Scope is a name - usually System or something like that. It's primarily used to group types together, so that the editor doesn't have to see the ca. 50 types in the background which make the solution work. Attributes Have Metadata Each attribute - let's say a field \"Color\" has more information which is needed for scenarios like the edit-UI. These items are standard content-items and also have the very same format as JSON entities - you can read about that in this blog. Content Types Have Metadata Content-types can have a lot of metadata - also mostly for the UI. An example is the help-text which is shown. This too is stored as normal JSON content-items . Limitations As of now (2sxc 9.7) the system will pick up the content-types stored there and everything works. BUT there is no built-in mechanism to edit these. We (2sic) can easily create content-types in a normal 2sxc and export them to json for this purpose, but as of now there is no GUI to do so. This should not affect you, as it's not meant to be managed by anybody else than us as of now. Special Stuff about the JSON Format Content Type Attributes must preserve Sort Order This is important, as it's relevant to the UI. All Attributes are Grouped by Type Because JSON is itself a very loose data-format, and certain types like dates are not auto-detectable, we decided to have the type-specification as a first-class citizen in the format. This allows for automatic, reliable type-checking when materializing objects.

Storage in the SQL Database in the EAV-Model This is simply stored as a string in the DB, in the original format like page:22 . Storage in the SQL Database in the JSON-Model This is simply stored as a JSON string in the original format like page:22 . Automatic Conversions The hyperlink data internally can contain values like: http://whatever/whatever - will not be converted /some-relative-url - will not be converted page:42 - will usually be converted to the real url of the page in DNN page:42?something=value - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters page:42#something=value - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters file:2750 - will usually be converted to the real url of the file in DNN file:2750?w=200 - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters (like for thumbnails) file:2750#page=2 - this will also be converted, but keeping the parameters (like for pdf-page-links) In 99% of all use cases, you want to generate html with a real link, which is why the content-objects in Razor will deliver an http:... instead of file:27 . Some demo-code: // assume that Content is a dynamic entity // assume that Image actually contains \"file:274\" <img src=\"@Content.Image\"> // the result is now <img src=\"/portals/0/adam/20603963uaothutaoer/daniel.jpg\"> Accessing the Real Inner Value In rare cases you may want the originl page:22 instead of the converted value. To do this, use AsEntity(yourObject) and then use the EAV API on IEntity to read the underlying original value. Special: Hyperlink Libraries A special use case is Libraries - where a hyperlink-field doesn't actually contain anything, but is a placeholder for ADAM assets. In such a scenario, you will use AsAdam(...) in your code to get the folders/files in the ADAM repository. Null Value Possible In some cases you may add a field to a type which already has Entities created previously. In this case the old data doesn't have a value for the field. If this happens, the field will return null , so you may need to catch this special exception in your code.

    "title": "In-Page Edit-Item Toolbars and Buttons | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "In-Page Edit-Item Toolbars and Buttons 2sxc provides super-fast in-page buttons and toolbars for the content-editor to manage and edit everything. The system is very advanced, so what at first may seem trivial can become very complex as you go deeper into customizing it. This is why we are providing an overview. Best Practice: Hover vs. Inline Toolbars The toolbars for the editor can be hovering above the elements - usually appearing on mouse-over, or directly inline. Hover-toolbars can also be configured to always be visible, but this is a rare use case. Recommendation Hover-Toolbars are highly recommended. These appear when the mouse moves over the item to be edited. It gives the editor a perfect preview of the page, without cluttering the screen with buttons. Toolbars which hover and are always visible make sense for buttons which the editor may not discover on his own if they are not always visible, or when the item to hover on would be very small, and hard to discover. Inline (non-hovering) toolbars which are always visible should be used as rarely as possible. A good use for this are admin-tables where each row should directly show the edit-button in a buttons-column. How the System Work To make the magic work, these parts are involved: Server side code detects that editing is allowed. This automatically adds context-information to the module in the form of a hidden JSON attribute. You can see these large attributes in the source-code if you are logged in. It also ensures that the edit-javascripts are loaded by the page. This is either auto-detected, because the user has edit-rights Or it was explicitly enabled using @Edit.Enable(...) in razor . Server side code adds stuff to mark where toolbars should appear... ...either (new in 2sxc 9.40) it adds hidden JSON attributes called sxc-toolbar='{...}' to any tag that should have a hover-menu with the desired configuration and settings , added like this <div @Edit.TagToolbar(...)>...</div> in razor ...or it adds an empty <ul toolbar='{...}' settings='{...}> tag to the page, also with the configuration and settings , added using @Edit.Toolbar(...) in razor or the [Content.Toolbar] equivalent in tokens . These toolbars can also hover using an old convention of adding an sc-element class, but that is deprecated since 2sxc 9.40. JavaScript on the client looks at the HTML and picks up both the special <ul> tags as well as all tags having the sxc-toolbar attribute, reads the configuration and generates the necessary html-tags with the buttons and hover-effects. Based on the context-information and the configuration it will choose if advanced button should appear (like edit-template, which only admins should see). Special hover-placement and other visual things are picked up from the settings . If an editor interacts with the menu, each click will result in JavaScript looking at the closest context-information in the page, and using this information to run a command like edit , new or template-develop . When a command has completed, certain code may reload the view, either using ajax or by reloading the page if ajax is not supported by this particular view. Short Example The toolbar system is 100% JavaScript but offers special helpers to improve the experience in other dev-environments. Here's a simple example using Razor: <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> @Content.Title </h1> This creates a invisible toolbar which appears and hovers when the mouse moves over the <h1> tag (if the user has edit-permissions). The toolbar has all the buttons for this Content item. The next example is similar, but instead of all default buttons it only shows the edit-button: <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, actions: \"edit\")> @Content.Title </h1> Basic Toolbar Concepts and Functionality each toolbar is specific to a content-item a page can have many toolbars, each for a different element / purpose usually toolbars are invisible until the mouse hovers over the area to be edited (best practice, but configurable) various show and hover/float behaviors each toolbar is fully customizable - both in regards to which buttons are shown as well as how they are grouped, how they look etc. toolbars are multi-language easy to add in your template or to your JS Apps mobile capable with shake support How to Use We'll try to provide you with full details of the toolbars for advanced use cases. But in most cases you will need the default toolbars minimal or no customizations. For these common cases you should continue on. Razor @Edit.TagToolbar(...) attribute (hovering, recommended) Razor @Edit.Toolbar(...) (non-hovering) Token Toolbars (using simpler placeholder templates) Core JavaScript Architecture Parts Commands This is what is executed when a button is clicked. Commands are things like edit . Some commands need additional parameters like EntityId , resulting in a command more like run('edit', {EntityId: 27}) . Commands can also be run without toolbars, for example from edit links in tables etc. You can read more about Commands, incl. the full list of current command, parameters and how to create custom commands in the Commands section. Buttons This is a square thingy with an icon, which is will run a Command . When the button is created, it is fully configured with icon, commmand and command-parameters. Button-Group : This is a set of one or more -Buttons_ which are shown together. Often there will be a more button at one end of the set, which will show another button-group when clicked. Toolbar : This is a set of one or more Button-Groups . Toolbar Builder : This is an API-layer which builds the HTML for the Toolbar . Toolbar Bootstrapper : This will pick up HTML placeholders for toolbars and run the Toolbar Builder for these.

In this version we also changed the CSS functionality to not use the sc-element attribute, but still support it for backward compatibility."

In certain cases it would be good if the razor-view could verify that the feature is enabled - for example to show a warning when it isn't enabled yet. This is what the Features API is for. How To Use This example is taken from Mobius Forms and the code can be found in the Mobius Github Repo . @using ToSic.Eav.Configuration @{ // show warning if the save-attachments in web api isn't activated var reqFeatures = new[]{new Guid(\"ecdab0f6-4692-4544-b1e7-72581f489f6a\")}; FeaturesDisabledException missingException; if(!Features.EnabledOrException(reqFeatures, \"Warning: file upload won't work yet, as it hasn't been enabled.\", out missingException)) { <div class=\"alert alert-warning\"> @missingException.Message </div> } } The code above checks if a feature is enabled, and if not, will show a message to the viewer that this must be enabled first. What you Need To Know The API lies in the namespace ToSic.Eav.Configuration The Features object is static, so you don't need to create it, just use the commands on it ATM the public API has the following commands Enabled(Guid featureId) which checks if a feature is enabled Enabled(IEnumerable<Guid> featureIds) which checks if multiple features are enabled EnabledOrException(IEnumerable<Guid> featIds, string message, out FeaturesDisabledException) which will check and give you an error object back, which you can either throw or show the message of (like in the example above) Finding Feature GUIDs At the moment there is no catalog of feature GUIDs yet, and sometimes you may actually create your own. So for now you'll mainly need this for features of 2sxc / eav, and you can simply look them up in the code, or see them in the features management of the installation you're developing on.

Once an app is accessed by code, a sophisticated internal system loads everything into the app-state which is then cached. Everything then uses this data, and save-operations usually do a partial update of the cache. This is one of the things that makes 2sxc and the EAV so amazingly fast.

The Content-Type will define what fields exist, what is required and what order the fields will appear in when editing the item. Identity of a Content Type: Name and StaticName Each content-type has a Name , which is nice for a human to read, use and program with. There is a second identifier called StaticName which is usually a GUID, but in rare cases it's a string like App-Settings . This identifier is used internally - for example when a View references a Content-Type. Storage Most Content-Types are stored in the database, including all the Content-Types in your App. Special global Content-Types are stored in the file system. These are called File-Based Content-Types Metadata of Content-Types and Attributes Both the Content-Type and Attributes can have Metadata providing more information about them.

Notes and Clarifications In general, you can override this event to prepare data. It has a few benefits like It's always called, even if the data is not templated - for example when it's streamed as JSON or when it's prepared for search indexing In the future, most data-preparations will be possible through a visual designer, but for now, this is the best way to go.

You can override this event to change how data is presented to the search, for example by bundling items together, or by giving items different URLs so that search knows that they are to appear on a sub-page. How to use In your razor page (.cshtml file) you can add a script block implementing this, as follows: @using ToSic.Eav.Run; @using ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.Run; @using ToSic.Sxc.Search; @functions { // this method is optional - your code wouldn't need it, but it's in here to show how it would work together // the CustomizeData would be called first, and potentially modify what is in the Data-object public override void CustomizeData() { // Don't customize anything, nothing to customize in this case } /// <summary> /// Populate the search - ensure that each entity has an own url/page /// </summary> /// <param name=\"searchInfos\"></param> /// <param name=\"moduleInfo\"></param> /// <param name=\"startDate\"></param> public override void CustomizeSearch(Dictionary<string, List<ISearchItem>> searchInfos, IContainer moduleInfo, DateTime beginDate) { foreach (var si in searchInfos[\"Default\"]) { // tell the search system what url it should use in the result si.QueryString = \"mid=\"+ (moduleInfo as DnnContainer).Id + \"&feature=\" + si.Entity.EntityId; } } } The code above will skip customizing any data (but often you would want that too), then CustomizeSearch modifies the list of search-items before they are indexed. How it works In general everything will work automatically. This is what happens: 2sxc will retrieve the data added to this module 2sxc will call the CustomizeData() event if the template has such an event. In this event, your code can add more data to the module as needed. Note that during the search index, no Request-variables exist. So your method will cause an error if it does something like var x = Request[\"Category\"]. In case of an error, the index will still continue to work, but your changes to the data will fail To help you with this, a new property called Purpose was added. It tells you if this view/template was created for displaying or for indexing. 2sxc will then use the data and create SearchItems, ready to index. Each entity will be turned into a SearchItem Each Content-Type will have an own list (so you can differentiate between all the SearchItems for the Categories and the SearchItems for the Questions) Multi-Language is handled correctly, so the English index will contain the English content, etc. 2sxc will then call a CustomizeSearch() event, so your code could provide changes. A common scenario is to say that each entity (say each question) has a different URL (say a details-page). So even though all entities belong to the module (and DNN only knows of this one module), the module can say that each entity has an own details page. One this is done, the SearchItems are converted to official SearchDocument-objects and handed over to DNN Read also Purpose - which tells you why the current code is running so you could change the data added CustomizeData Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App FAQ with Categories More links: Description of the feature on 2sxc docs History Introduced in 2sxc 6.2 Added support for newer DNN versions at a later time - not sure when"

These scripts need to know what Context they are in, meaning which DNN-Module, which 2sxc-App, which Zone, permissions etc. By default, this context is already provided by the environment, but sometimes a new context must provide overrides. This is rare, but important, for example using Inner Content (Content Within Other Content) . So the ContextAttributes will provide this information in some hidden html. How it works The Edit.ContextAttributes(...) is always used inside an HTML-tag and will add some attributes with JSON. Any buttons or actions inside that tag will then find this information, and assume that it is has precendence over the global information. What do You need to do? By default, this context is already provided by the 2sxc-environment, but sometimes a new context must provide overrides. For example using Inner Content (Content Within Other Content) . For this you need the Edit.ContextAttributes - see docs here . How to use This example shows the title and will add the standard editing-buttons for the Content item. Here's an Inner Content (Content Within Other Content) example: <div class=\"app-blog-text sc-content-block-list\" @Edit.ContextAttributes(post, field: \"DesignedContent\")> @foreach(var cb in @post.DesignedContent) { @cb.Render(); } </div> In this example, the Edit.ContextAttributes will add some attributes with JSON, which will help the toolbars inside that loop to correctly edit those items, and not the main item around it. How it works The Edit.ContextAttributes(...) is always used inside an HTML-tag and will add some attributes with JSON. Any buttons or actions inside that tag will then find this information, and assume that it is has precendence over the global information. Using ContextAttributes These context-attributes enhance an HTML-tag, so that buttons inside that tag can be in a different context than the original context. Here's a common example: imagine you have a 2sxc-instance (a module showing 2sxc-data) and all the buttons there know the App-ID, the Zone, the Content-Type etc. Inside this module, you can have multiple items but they all still work well in the original context (all items are in the same app, so an edit-dialog will also know the AppId).

In 2sxc 9.9 we are now able to specify multiple authors, allowing queries like \"give me all items which have all these authors\" or \"give me all items which have any of these authors\". This works using the separation-character, which is usually a comma , but could be something different (in case your items have commas in the texts you're comparing).

Here's where you set it: All Operators (2sxc 9.9+) Untill 2sxc 9.8, you could not specify an operator, and contains was the assumed operator. In 9.9 we added a lot more. To explain what each does, assume that our main stream contains items of BlogPost and we only want to keep the posts having certain Tags . Here's the list, each is explained more below: contains - will return all items (BlogPosts), having all the children (tags) specified containsany - will return all items (BlogPosts) having any of the children (tags) specified not-contains will return all items (BlogPosts) not-having-all of the children (tags). So it will also return those items, having some of the children. not-containsany will return all items (BlogPosts) having none of the children (tags) specified. any will return all items (BlogPosts) having any children at all (tags). So the filter is ignored. This is the same as count=0. not-any will return all items (BlogPosts) having no children (tags). first will return all items (BlogPosts) where the first child (tag) is one of the filter-options. This is for scenarios where you say the first tag is a primary-category or similar. not-first will return all items (BlogPosts) where the first children (tags) is not one of the filter values. count will return all items (BlogPosts) having a specific amount of children (tags) not-count will return all items (BlogPosts) not having a specific amount of children (tags) Filtering On Fields other than Title and ID (9.9+) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to specify which field you want to compare (before it was always Id or Title). Here's an example: Filtering by Relationship-Count (9.9+) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to filter by amount of relationships - so you could say \"give me all blog-posts with exactly 2 tags\": Note: you can also reverse this, so instead of count you can use not-count to get all the items that don't match this requirement. Filtering by Has-Any (9.9+) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the ability to filter by Limitations of the RelationshipFilter Note that as of now (2sxc 9.9) the RelationshipFilter: can only seek child-items Programming With The RelationshipFilter DataSource We recommend to use the Visual Query where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript.

    "keywords": "EAV / 2sxc / DNN Architecture 2sxc is simple to use, but to enable that, it's pretty sophisticated on the inside. We'll give you an overview here, so you can better understand what you are using. Overall Architecture The Storage Systems This is fairly straight forward - data can be stored in SQL (spread across tables or using JSON) and the File System (stored as JSON). Note that assets like images are not handled here, but in the EAV-Apps layer (see below). The EAV Layer The data management system underneath everything is called the EAV - which stands for Entity , Attribute , Value . Anything in that namespace is about internal data models, reading/saving data etc. So anything inside the ToSic.Eav.Data is all about the internals, which you only need in special scenarios. The same applies to ToSic.Eav.Apps which is the sub-system responsible for combining data into virtual bundles called Apps . You can usually ignore this. The SXC Layer On top of the EAV layer we have the Sxc layer. It's responsible for Content Management on top of the App model provided by the EAV . The Sxc layer provides things like IDynamicEntity to let you code like @Content.Title . This is usually more interesting for you, but still fairly generic, because 2sxc is also meant to work with other platforms like NopCommerce, Orchard or Oqtane, but it hasn't been implemented yet. The DNN Layer On top of the Sxc layer we have the Dnn layer. It connects 2sxc with Dnn. Usually when you're writing code and want to know about the API, you'll typically start here, and drill down to the other APIs as needed. Architecture of the EAV Layer Inside the EAV you'll find a whole ecosystem of parts which make the magic happen. Infrastructure This is very internal stuff, to make sure everything happens. You will usually not go here. Most if it is also not public API. Areas of interest may be the ToSic.Eav.Logging or ToSic.Eav.LookUp . Core Data Models This is more interesting and relevant to you, when you want to dive deep into the data model. Again you should note that this is advanced stuff. You'll find it in ToSic.Eav.Data - the most common bit you may care about is IEntity and IContentType . Data Processing This is where things get relevant for you. Check out the ToSic.Eav.DataSources to find all the bits and pieces used to process, filter and cache data. Storage This is still more an internal bit, and as of now you shouldn't use it. App System and Assets Another part that you may want to know more about. Here is where data is clustered together into virtual containers called Apps . These contain all the content-types and items of an App. It also has view-definitions, Content-Blocks (the logical unit usually called a Module in DNN) and way more. You'll find it in ToSic.Eav.Apps . The assets - usually using ADAM - are found in ToSic.Eav.Apps .Assets. Web API This is ATM an internal section, mainly for connecting DNN WebAPIs to the EAV. Not documented as of now. The Fine Line Between Eav.Apps and Sxc.* To keep the architecture clean, it's important to draw a clear line between Apps and what Sxc does. Basically it's this: Eav.Apps are virtual containers bundling things together. This means content-types, data, queries, settings, etc. Sxc is all about (Web) Content Management. So anything related to views, templates, assets, content-blocks is in Sxc. Specifically, these things may not be in Apps, and must be in Sxc Templates Rendering Engines like Token/Razor Content-Blocks Custom WebApi (which is also kind of a dynamic rendering engine)"

    "title": "EAV / 2sxc Data Flow | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "EAV / 2sxc Data Flow 2sxc is simple to use, but to enable that, it's pretty sophisticated on the inside. Let's take a look at how data is accessed, cached, queried, maybe cached again, and provided to the output. Note All the data handling systems come from the EAV . This is then enhanced and customized by Sxc and Sxc.Dnn. Core Paradigms Rule #1: Data is Reactive As you'll soon see, the EAV performs a lot of automatic lookup and caching, but as a first rule, this happens Reactively , only when data is actually accessed. This is similar to how ReactiveX or NgRx work, just much simpler. Rule #2: Data is Read-Only Any data the code receives as IEntity objects is read-only. This allows for a much more robust data model and API which in a CMS environment is usually 99% read, 1% write. Rule #3: Data Always Comes from DataSources Inside the system everything is loosely coupled (think Depedency Injection). So anything requesting data will always use a DataSource provided by some magic, and then use what was given. Rule #4: Data is Managed and Cached per App Once data from an App was requested, the entire app is loaded and cached. Within an app a lot of data can be linked together using Content-Types, Relationships, Sub-Lists, Metadata and more. If we would lazy-load this on-demand from the storage system (SQL), it would result in a ping-pong of requests, which would be very inefficient. This unit of cache is called an AppState . Overall Flow When Creating Html Imagine that your custom Razor template in a DNN module is initialized. Here's what happens: 1. Preparation 2sxc starts with the ModuleId as it's inside a DNN Module. It will then create a Block for this InstanceId (which is the ModuleId). The Block internally will create a CmsBlock DataSource , pass in the InstanceId and then wait for data to pour in. The CmsBlock knows about DNN, and will use the InstanceId to get the ModuleSettings in DNN. This contains only 2 pieces of information: the AppId which it is visualizing, and a ContentBlockId which is the full configuration of the Content-Block which will be shown. The CmsBlock also knows if the user is an editor (which would result in draft-items being included). The CmsBlock DataSource will then ask the underlying EAV for this block configuration (stored as an Entity) which is then loaded from the Cache. When the configuration is found, the CmsBlock then knows what View will be used. The CmsBlock itself is a DataSource and is now configured to deliver the data which the view expects. Note The CmsBlock doesn't know about the internals of the cache, it just asks for it. The cache will auto-initialize the AppState if it hasn't been accessed before. Note The CmsBlock will also not load any data yet. It just knows what would be loaded, should it ever be accessed. Tip When you use views which don't have a content-type configured, then properties like Data , Content or Header will be null. But App.Data will still work. 2. Execution The Block is now ready. 2sxc now consults the View to find out which Engine to use (Razor or Token). It will now load this engine, give it the Block and wait for the resulting Html to be created. The engine loads the template and lets it do what it should. If the template has code accessing Data then the underlying source will retrieve the necessary data. If it's a normal content-view, then the items provided will be the ones which an editor has manually added, since they were referenced in the ContentBlock. If the view relies on a Query, then this query is built and will be waiting to execute if the data is accessed. If the code accesses App . Data then this data source will build up everything necessary so it just works. If the code accesses App . Query then the underlying system will prepare the Query as needed. Note All the data retrieving features like Data do not actually retrieve any data unless accessed. This also means that Content or Header won't use any CPU cycles unless accessed. The same goes for App.Data - nothing is processed unless it's accessed. Note The queries are only provided by the App for immediate use. They won't be built or executed unless they are actually read. Overall Flow when Creating WebAPIs This works just like the Html creation, except that we don't need an engine. The code which inherits from ApiController now works with the data as needed. The same lazy-execution rules apply: neither Data , Content , App.Data or App.Query use any CPU cycles, unless the data is actually pulled by reading it.

    "title": "DNN/Evoq Page Versioning / Publishing and Workflow | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "DNN/Evoq Page Versioning / Publishing and Workflow This page explains how a DNN / Evoq does page versioning and workflow, and how to leverage this with 2sxc. Background: DNN / Evoq Page/Module Versioning DNN / Evoq had a few different ways of doing versioning, but since DNN 7.4.2 it basically uses a model which works as follows: Each page has a live version number (for this demo we'll say version P27 - for page 27). On this page, various modules exist, each having their own version number. Let's say we have a gallery-module which is currently on version 6 (MG6) and a module with a form in version 12 (MF12). So the page information currently has: P27 live Module 1: MG6 live Module 2: MF12 live Basic Example with Adding Module If a new module with a form is added in between, DNN will do the following P28 draft (P27 is still live ) Mod 1: MG6 live (same version on live and draft ) Mod 2: MF1 new , regarded as draft Mod 3: MF13 draft (the position has changed, so the module info has changed) As further changes to modules additions / removals / reordering happen, this happens on the P28 version only. So even if we delete or rename a module, the live version will not show this. So DNN mechanims incl. moving/renaming of modules is a DNN/Evoq responsiblity, and is versioned by DNN/Evoq. We'll talk about the internal content of a module further down. Publishing a Page Basically when an editor publishes a page, DNN will do the following: set P28 to the published page tell each module to publish in that version (in case the module support inner versioning - read on...) DNN / Evoq Workflows Because these topics are almost undocumented - and exist in different implementations, they are confusing. You need to know the following about workflows: Workflows apply to the page only, so pages need to know if they have a workflow and which one Modules don't know about these workflows... ...because Modules only get notified when the workflow reaches a \"publish\" state Background: Module Inside/Inner Versioning Modules have their own content which may or may not be versioned. 99% of all modules don't version their content and have no history. And 99.9% don't support DNN/Evoq page versions & publishing . So IF a module doesn't know about these mechanisms, then changes inside that module will not be versioned and they will be live immediately as they are applied. But let's assume our modules do support this, and let's say the gallery with module-info in V6 (it was moved a few times, so it has 6 versions) still has the initial V1 content, which we'll call MGi1 (Module Gallery inside V1). Module Version Tree with Inner Version So let's look at the versioning tree as it really is P27 live Mod 1: MG6 live with MGi1 Mod 2: MF12 live with MFi26 (had made configuration changes, each versioned) Now let's simulate a change... Inner Content Changes Let's say the editor makes a small change to the Form-module. This will notify DNN of a change. As this happens, it must tell DNN that it has a new version - like this, so DNN will also place the page in a new version (for later publishing): P28 draft Mod 1: MG6 live with MGi1 live Mod 2: MF12 live with MFi27 draft Note that if the form module makes more changes, it can choose to report this or not, since basically the newest version is a draft already, on a draft-page. Inner Content Publishing Now once the user decides to publish this page, each module (incl. the Forms-Module) will be notified to publish it's version. DNN will tell the form which version it should publish (in this case v27). The form must take care of whatever processing to ensure that this version is now live / public. 2sxc Support for DNN / Evoq Publishing 2sxc support the core parts of DNN/Evoq Publishing and versioning. To be more specific, it will detect if the page requires a publishing workflow tell DNN/Evoq that on-page content was edited modify the GUI to only allow draft/publish options as it corresponds with the page information listen to DNN/Evoq messages to publish on-page information This sounds simple, but it's very complex because 2sxc can be used in many scenarios, and in some it's not always clear when to draft or publish something. So there are some exceptions, which are documented below. Activating Page Publishing Feature on 2sxc You don't have to do anything - 2sxc asks the environment (DNN/Evoq) it it expects any publishing steps, and will automatically adjust its behavoir. Making Changes Start a DNN-Page Versioning This too happens automatically, if the page has a publishing setup in DNN/Evoq. Auto-Draft and Auto-Publish explained To be sure you understand what's going on, please note the following: Only changes which directly relate to a page cause auto-draft / auto-publish Example 1: A user changes a blog post on a blog-page. The page will get a new draft version and the live blog will show the old one, while the draft will show the new one. When the page is published, the draft will become live. Changes to content-items which are not directly tied to a page, will not cause drafting / publishing Example 2: When the user edits the blog post he also creates another category (which is used as data and not as on-page content). This category is immediately live, but will probably not show up as it's only used in the edited blog-post. Example 3: An admin-user goes into the admin UI and creates a blog post from within the admin-UI. It will not auto-default to draft , as this is not specific to any page. But if the user manually sets it to draft, it will be published when a page showing it is released. Restoring Previous Versions DNN / Evoq has a mechanism for restoring previous page versions, and when implemented perfectly, all modules inside it could also revert back to the state it was in at that time. Such a perfect world is hard to implement and nearly impossible in a dynamic-content setup. For example, apps may have been deleted or content-types (schemas) may have changed. So the idea sounds good, but is impossible to implement correctly. So 2sxc goes the pragmatic way: You can restore any item to a previous version - so you can always roll back a blog-post to a previous copy, but putting the page back into an old version will not roll back anything inside a 2sxc-module. To Restore previous versions of content-items, use the history (clock) icon in the toolbar. Technical Deep Dive - Behind the Scenes In case you run into trouble or need to know more about the mechanisms, here's what you need to know What is an On-Page Change and What is Not By definition, any item created or modified directly from a toolbar button in the front end is regarded as an On-Page change and will start the page-draft process. This is basically all the buttons which normal (non-admin) users see. If you haven't heard of hiding admin-buttons, please read the concept on hiding advanced features . Specifically, this includes the following actions: editing content directly from a toolbar button adding new content to the page from a toolbar button moving items up/down in a content-item list using a toolbar button replacing an item on a page using the toolbar button The following actions are not regarded as on-page changes, and don't auto-force drafting: editing any data from the Admin-UI editing app-resources or app-settings creating / modifying views importing data / importing apps What is Published on Page-Publish and What Not When a page is published, DNN/Evoq will tell each module that it should now publish that specific version assigned to that page version. When this happens, 2sxc does the following: Retrieves the (usually invisible/secret) content-group entity which contains the information, what template and what items are shown on this module. This one is probably stored as a draft from previous changes, as this one keeps track of the items to show and the order to show them in. This draft is then published. Reviews all items on the four primary in-streams, checks each entity and publishes draft versions. The streams it will process are: Default (this is the one provided on Content) Presentation ListContent (the header-content item) ListPresentation (the header presentation item) Note that other streams are not auto-published. This is to prevent side-effects. For example, a Blog-View could have additional streams to visualize authors, categories etc. but these will not be auto-published, as it is assumed that these are helper-data and not specifically on-page data for this page. Publishing Additional Items If you want to auto-publish additional items, just add them to a stream PartOfPage . Inner Content Handling (Very Rich Content) Inner Content is not currently treated as belonging to the page, as it is inside content which is already drafted/published. So inner-content is always published when created. Note that this is not fully tested/implemented, you may have unexpected consequences when working with inner content. Image And Asset Handling Images and assets are not versioned / published, as DNN provides no effective way to enable this. So as of now, the following will happen: if a content-type has a file-field using ADAM with a single file (not library), then draging in an additional file will behave like the publishing, because the new file has a new number, and this is not in use till the item is published if the user drags in an updated file with the same name, it will internally receive a number at the end, and also stay unpublished, as it's a different file on the server if a user manually replaces a file (not drag-drop in ADAM) or deletes a file and then uploads the file with the same name, then this file is live, as it really changed the file on the server if you are using a library-field in ADAM (often used in galleries), then these files are automatically live as well, and deleted files are also removed immediately In case you are using an ADAM library and would like to only show the files which existed before you created an unpublished draft, this can be done in your template. Just remember that certain changes (like file-changes on the server) could change the modified date, and that deleting files also really removes live files as well. Here's how you can change your Razor: @* before, showing all files *@ @foreach(var pic in AsAdam(Content, \"Files\").Files) { <span>@pic.FileName, @pic.LastModificationTime</span><br> } @* only showing \"older\" files *@ @foreach(var pic in ((IEnumerable<ToSic.SexyContent.Adam.AdamFile>)AsAdam(Content, \"Files\").Files).Where(f => f.LastModificationTime <= Content.Modified)) { <span>@pic.FileName, @pic.LastModificationTime</span><br> } Notes and Clarifications As mentioned, this is the default setup. In the case of data-oriented apps, which query data from somewhere, you may have other expectations. At the moment there is no additional mechanism to customize this any further, but we believe that you can easily cover all possible scenarios with this setup.

    "keywords": "Concept: Features To increase the security of 2sxc, many features are only available if actively enabled . This reduced the security surface and hardens the installation . A feature is a functionality of 2sxc or EAV, which can be enabled/disabled at system level. Each feature is identified by a GUID, and all features are disabled by default. Some examples of features: define permissions by user ( new in 9.30 ) use the new (beta) Angular 5 UI for editing ( new in 9.30 ) use standard 2sxc forms to allow public users to submit data ( new in 9.30 ) let certain users save draft-only data ( new in 9.30 ) enable paste-image-from-clipboard (beta, new in 9.30 ) Behavior if Feature is Disabled If a feature is not enabled and code needs to use the feature, it will either show an error OR simply skip that functionality. This varies from feature to feature. If an error is thrown, the system will include a link to the missing feature as well as instructions to enable. Managing Features This is done through the Apps-Management. This is what it looks like: Read about managing features in the blog about features-management How the Feature-Configurations are Stored Features use a json-file called features.json located in the desktopmodules/tosic_sexycontent/.data-custom/configurations folder. Additional Security Mechanisms For added security, there are two layers of additional protection: The configuration contains a fingerprint of the current installation (so that an attacker cannot simply replace the features-configuration with an own copy). This fingerprint should match the fingerprint of the installation for the configuration to be valid. Read more about fingerprinting in this blog . When the configuration is created, it is signed by the 2sxc.org server using a digital certificate and verified when the features are loaded. Note: the security features are already built into 9.30 but not yet enforced. This is because it's a fairly new setup, and we want to be sure that we don't accidentally disable something if something doesn't work properly.

Note that if something doesn't have custom permissions, you'll still have default permissions that apply (see below): Introduction to Permissions Permissions are usually a list of zero or more permissions - like this: When you edit a permission, it looks like this: To access the permissions, you'll usually find a person-button in the actions of an item: Permission Overview Items which can accept permissions are: Content Types - permissions regulate who can create / edit items of that type Views / Templates - permissions regulate, who can see this view if accessed through url-parameter Apps - permissions regulate across all content types, who may edit/create etc. new in 9.30 Fields - permissions regulate, who may upload files new in 9.30 Permissions consist of the following parts: Requirements - what the current user must fulfill, for it to apply Grants - what is allowed with this permission Understanding Requirements For a permission to apply, you must specify for whom this is. To do this, you can choose various requirements: DNN Permissions: in this case, you can specify if the user has view permissions, this applies User Identity: in this case you can specifiy a user GUID new in 9.30, requires the feature to be enabled Group ID(s): if a user is in any of these DNN groups, the rule applies new in 9.30, requires the feature to be enabled Understanding Grants If a permission applies, it will grant the current user some rights - like creating or editing data. Grants are internally coded as a letter of the alphabet, like: c for create d for delete č for create drafts only f for full (all) permissions A grant can contain multiple rights - like crud for create, read, update, delete. Many grants like f will automatically grant other things (obviously). Default Permissions It's important to understand that for many scenarios, default permissions already apply. Super-users may always do everything, and admins may read/write all data. These default permissions cannot be reduced with new permissions at the moment, so an admin always has read/write and cannot be degraded to lower permissions. Using Permissions in Code As of now, the permissions API isn't final, so if you want to use it in code, you can immitate code you can find in the source. But these commands will change when the API is final, so you'll end up making adjustments.

These kinds of fields are called Entity Fields . When configured correctly, an entity-field shows a dropdown of items. So in the case of a book, the Author field may show a dropdown of Person items. There are different types of relationships: 1:n means that one thing can refer to many other things - like a book which points to many categories n:1 means that many things can refer to one thing - like many books pointing to the same author n:n means that many things can refer to many things - like many blog-posts pointing to many tags (the blog can refer to many tags, and each tag may be pointed to by many blogs) 1:1 relationships are when one thing refers to one other thing, and neither are re-used again.

You can set many things, in this demo we only set: GlobalName (required) - this is used for lookup/storing a reference to this source), should be unique NiceName (optional) a nice label in the UI HelpLink (optional) a help-link there are more properties, but these are the important ones. See ToSic.Eav.DataSources .Query.VisualQueryAttribute More on the Constructor and Provide The constructor is in charge of wiring up the data-source. It should not get any data - because the data may not be needed and because configuration isn't loaded yet. The important command you need to know is Provide . This will do a few things Ensure that the Out stream offers a stream with a name - if not specified it's going to offer the Default stream. Wire that up to the method (in this case GetList) which will be called if the Out -stream is ever requested More on the GetList Method and AsEntity The first thing you need to know is that it won't be called if nobody requests the Out stream. If the the Out is requested, this method must return a list (actually an enumerable) of Entities. The most common way to build entities is to prepare a Dictionary<string, object> and convert it to an Entity using AsEntity . Note that AsEntity has many more features, which are not in this demo to keep it simpler.

    "keywords": "DataSources DataSources are IDataSource objects which deliver one or many DataStreams , which contain a bunch of content-items. There are many data-sources, and most of them will... ...either get data from somewhere external like SQL, CSV, REST or the EAV-cache and provide this for further use - then it's a pure IDataSource ...or receive data from another DataSource, then process/filter this and provide the result for further use, in which case it's both an IDataSource as well as an IDataTarget So DataSources can be joined together into a Query to do amazing things, like a CsvDataSource can read a CSV-file and provide the data as a stream on Entities on csvDs[\"Default\"] ... ...and pipe the result it to a CacheDataSource which caches the data for x-minutes ...then pipe it to a ValueFilterDataSource , which only shows the items where the Country matches the Url-parameters country ...then pipe it to a ValueSortDataSource, ordering it by LastName and then FirstName ...then pipe it to another CacheDataSource so that this common filter/sort combination will be kept for 5 minutes and then the result can be used in a Template or streamed as JSON to a JavaScript SPA. Understanding Data-Flow between DataSource Objects Each DataSource has a list of out-streams available on the .Out[\"StreamName\"] property, but usually access directly just with the DataSourceName[\"StreamName\"] . This is what also happens when you use the Data object and write foreach(var item in Data[\"Default\"]) . Aside from consuming data in your your template, most data-sources will simply offer the Out-Stream to other DataSources for further processing. Technically it's mapped like this: Cache.Out[\"Default\"] > ContentTypeFilter.In[\"Default\"] ... then some magic happens inside the ContentTypeFilter ... then the ContentTypeFilter.Out[\"Default\"] has the resulting items, which can again be used as an In on another DataSource, or simply used in your template Most DataSources will only have one In-stream and one Out-stream, but this is very variable depending on your need. Creating your own Custom DataSource short instruction to get started here's docs about the relevant API understanding configuration injection Understanding Configuration of Each DataSource Object The configuration uses a sophisticated token system to provide all necessary information. It is explained here . Common Use Cases of DataSource in C# Code You will usually use DataSource objects in these common cases: when templating in Razor, the Data object is a DataSource, usually having a Default stream ( Data[\"Default\"] ) and sometimes further streams like Data[\"ListContent\"] or Data[\"Categories\"] etc. when templating, the App.Data is also a DataSource providing a stream for each content-type in this app, like App.Data[\"BlogPost\"] or App.Data[\"Tag\"] every query is technically a DataSource, and in the query you define which DataStreams it has - if ever you use it in code, you'll see that App.Query[\"SortedTags\"] would be a DataSource and typically the Default stream would contain all these tags. a query is always a chain of DataSource doing one operation and passing it on to the next DataSource. How to use In your Razor-templates you'll usually work with these three sources: Data App.Data App.Query[...] Please read more about these in links. Creating DataSource Objects in C#/Razor Code Sometimes you want to have full control over what a DataSource does or what parameters it's using. This is easy: // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = CreateSource<ToSic.Eav.DataSources.EntityTypeFilter>(); allAuthors.TypeName = \"Authors\"; // access the data and automatically apply the filter/config var authors = allAuthors[\"Default\"]; Creating a Query in Code by Piping / Chaining Data sources What the visual-designer does is configure how DataSources are attached, mapping their in/out streams and adding parameters. You can also do this in code, but it's fairly advanced. You would usually want to do this, if you want to use a filter or something, but need to provide parameters which aren't available in the Visual Query Designer. Here's a simple example: // A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType) var allAuthors = CreateSource<EntityTypeFilter>(); allAuthors.TypeName = \"Author\"; // Sort by FullName var sortedAuthors = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthors.Attributes = \"FullName\"; // Sort by Fullname descending var sortedAuthorsDesc = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthorsDesc.Attributes = \"FullName\"; sortedAuthorsDesc.Directions = \"desc\"; // Sort by 2 fields var sortedAuthorsMult = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthorsMult.Attributes = \"Website,FullName\"; sortedAuthorsMult.Directions = \"asc, desc\"; // sort by internal EntityId var sortedAuthorsById = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors); sortedAuthorsById.Attributes = \"EntityId\"; Because the first allAuthors didn't specify an up-stream in the () empty brackes, it automatically gets attached to the App-Cache with all the data of the current app. So var allAuthors = CreateSource<EntityTypeFilter>(); will initially have all content-items at it's disposal. The most important thing to notice is that each additional data-source uses the first allAuthors DataSource as the default upstream DataSource. So when these sort/filter or do something, they will only receive the data already filtered by the allAuthors.

    "keywords": "Placeholder Tokens Often you need a text-based code which should be replaced at runtime with a real value from elsewhere. In DNN / 2sxc this is called a token , and they usually look like [Source:Property] . At runtime, this will then show a value like 27 . Note this article applies to tokens as they are handled server-side. There is a special token-like syntax in JavaScript, which is not discussed here. Note There is also a TokenEngine which uses the same Token mechanism to generate HTML. What you see here also applies to that, but it's actually a separate topic. Token Basics A token is a piece of text that looks like [Source:Property] , which will be replaced by an engine so that it will then be a value. For example, [QueryString:Page] is replaced with 2 if the current url has ?page=2 in it. You can research more about tokens in older docs here and in the full list of standard tokens , it's a standard DNN concept. Internally it uses a LookUp-Engine which itself uses LookUp-Sources - see LookUp & LookUpEngine . Additional Token Features in 2sxc/EAV The EAV and 2sxc have enhanced Tokens to a new level with these features: 1. Sub-Tokens A token like [App:Settings:PageSize] will go through a tree of info-objects to find an inner property if it exists. This only works on special object types that are specifically meant to provide sub-data. 2. Fallback A token like [QueryString:page||1] will deliver the url-param, and if that is empty, will deliver 1 . Note that you need 2 pipe symbols | because the convention is that after the first pipe you can have a format specifier like #.## . 3. Stacking Stacking with more Tokens: a token like [QueryString:PageSize||[App:Settings:PageSize]] will try the first token, and if it doesn't resolve, try the next one 4. Recursion A token can resolve into a token, which would then be looked up again. So if a token [Settings:Page||1] is used, and the setting Page is not a number but again a token like [QueryString:Page] , then it will... resolve Settings:Page and find Querystring:Page resolve QueryString:Page and maybe find something if that is empty, return the fallback 1 Some Token Examples [Portal:PortalId] would return the current portal Id [App:Settings:PageSize] would return the page size as configured in app-settings [QueryString:Id] would retrieve the id-parameter from the url (note: you should never put this in your data source) [Settings:ProductId] would retrieve the id as configured in the UI by the user [Settings:productId||27] would also try to get the id, but return 27 if not found Advanced Token Sources in Special Scenarios Some situations will have token sources beyond the default. For example, when configuring data sources they always have 2 more sources In - used like [In:Default:PageSize] Settings - used like [Settings:PageSize] There is another special override-token system (not documented) which is used for testing Also Read LookUp & LookUpEngine DataSource Concept: Configuration Injection using Tokens IDataStream DataSource API DataSource API: EnsureConfigurationIsLoaded History General Tokens introduced in 2sxc 1.0 Most enhancements were in 2sxc 07.00"

We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this. Version 10 Version 10 has a lot of small breaking changes because we restructured the internal API so it's consistent when we publish it. All these things shouldn't affect you, because they were internal APIs, but in case it does - here's what we did. Version 10.22 and 10.23 Renamed the RootDataSource and the Interface to IAppRoot Split SOC of the AppRoot DataSource so that caching, Root-Metadata and ListCache is fully separate Since the Logging system now auto-picks up the code lines and names of the methods, we simplified the commands and dropped some parameters. Moved quite a bit of the DataSource objects into sub-objects, again for SOC. Version 10.20-04 (ca. 2019-12-03) Renamed DataTableDataSource to DataTable , old name still works. Renamed ExternalDataDataSource to ExternalData , old name still works. Renamed ToSic.SexyContent.DataSources.ModuleDataSource to ToSic.Sxc.DataSources.CmsBlock , old name still works. Renamed ToSic.Eav.DataSources.VisualQuery.VisualQueryAttribute to ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Queries.VisualQueryAttribute , old name still works.

Moved the LookUp namespaces into the Core DLL Version 10.20-02 (ca. 2019-11-22) More internal changes which shouldn't affect anybody, but make the API ready for public docs... Moved/renamed the internal Eav.AppDataPackage to Eav.Apps.AppState Moved/renamed some internal interfaces like Entity... Did a major change for how Attribute<T> for relationships work. Before they were Attribute<EntityRelationship> and now they are Attribute<IEnumerable<IEntity>> .

Left old name compatible. Moved some extension methods for IEntity from ToSic.Eav.Data.Query to ToSic.Eav.Data Changed Permissions to be strongly typed EntityBased objects Version 10.20.01 (2019-11-12) Internal code now uses the term Header instead of ListContent .

The Razor pages and WebApi have this starting now, while old terms still work. Note that we're not creating a HeaderPresentation , because you should use Header.Presentation Version 9 Version 9.20.00 (2018-03-04) Minor breaking change in ADAM properties, like Id instead of FolderID which was a leftover of DNN naming. see full blog post Version 09.08.00 (2017-11-28) Minor breaking change List<IEntity> instead of Dictionary<int, IEntity> on the IDataSource see full blog post Version 09.03.00 (2017-10-08) Breaking change on inconsistent naming ToSic.Eav.IEntity instead of ToSic.Eav.Interfaces.IEntity . see full blog post"

Notes and Clarifications JSON Encode if using data-toolbar attribute If you're adding this in the HTML, then everything must be correctly JSON encoded (which isn't exactly fun). So if you plan to do that, we recommend to put most of the JS in an external file and just put the call to it in the button itself. More Specs On Click The second example shows 3 additional variables which are available inside the click event.

    "keywords": "Html & JS: Calling Commands of the CMS Whenever you press a button in the edit-ui, a edit-command is handled by the javascript layer. These commands are things like edit an item on the screen open the layout -picker dialog for a content-block To keep things simple, these commands all have the convention of using a short command name like new , some parameters like entityId which differ for each command and usually some context like this is happening in the module 7503 . How to use In most cases you don't have to even think about this, because the hover-buttons will automatically call the command as needed. But there are cases where you may want to do so yourself - for example with very custom buttons or if you want to automate something. Here's an example: <!-- quick version with name only --> <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).manage.run('layout', event)\"> change layout </a> <!-- expanded version --> <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).manage.run({ action: 'layout' }, event)\"> change layout </a> <!-- expanded version with many params --> <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).manage.run({ action: 'new', contentType: 'BlogPost' }, event)\"> createBlogPost </a> These examples example gets the $2sxc-controller related to the <a> tag using $2sxc(this) and thereby giving it a context so it knows what module-id, etc. Then it executes the command. Here's a fairly realistic setup using Razor and custom buttons in HTML: @if(Edit.Enabled) { <ol> <li> <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"layout\"})'>layout</a> </li> <li> <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Dummy\"})'>new</a> </li> <li> <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"edit\", \"entityId\": @Content.EntityId})'>edit #@Content.EntityId</a> </li> <li> <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"edit\", \"useModuleList\": true, \"sortOrder\": 0 })'>edit slot 0 of module list</a> </li> <li>manage table of <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"contentitems\"})'>items of the type used in this template</a> or of <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"contentitems\", contentType: \"Quotes\"})'>Quotes</a> </li> </ol> } Maybe you also want to put the command-construction in more code, like this: // the function which does this function openLayout(moduleId){ var command = { action: \"layout\" } $2sxc(moduleId).manage.run(command); } // the jquery call to do this on-load $(function() { openLayoutOnPageLoad(740); }) Running a Command Always use the sxc-controller of a module, then access the .manage.run(...) method to run a command. There are 3 calls you can use: run(\"layout\") - for simple commands requiring only the name run(\"new\", { contentType: \"BlogPost\" }) - for additional parameters run({ action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\" }) - does the same as above run(..., event) - if you had an event like click, it's best to always include it as last parameter Some Examples Every action in the UI is a command, and for it to run, it must know a few things, like var sxc = $2sxc(7523); // get sxc for moduleId 7523 var newCommand = { action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\" }; sxc.manage.run(newCommand); var editItemCommand = { action: \"edit\", entityId: 760 }; sxc.manage.run(editItemCommand); var editSlot7Params = { useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 7 }; sxc.manage.run(\"edit\", editSlot7Params); Command With Custom Code There is a command called custom which is meant to be used for this.

    "keywords": "Html: In-Page Edit Toolbars and Buttons When a user is logged on and has edit permissions, he should see buttons to edit his content or perform other actions. This is all done in HTML / JavaScript. By default, the server will render this in places defined by the template using placeholders like @Edit.TagToolbar(Content) and similar. Note that usually this HTML is generated by a server-side template, and will usually be wrapped in a if-user-logged-in condition. So if you want to do things differently, here's how - just remember that this is an advanced use case so it's a bit harder than what you're used to with 2sxc :). How to Use The most common use-case is actually to provide some HTML, which the JavaScript will pick up automatically and convert into a menu. The syntax was revised in 2sxc 9.40+, which is what we show here. The previous syntax is still supported, but not recommended any more: <!-- this is the default toolbar for first content item assigned to this module --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": {\"sortOrder\":0,\"useModuleList\":true} }'> </div> <!-- this is a toolbar for a content-item with the id 6875 --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": {\"entityId\":6875} }'> </div> <!-- this could be a custom toolbar for showing a new-button only --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": {\"contentType\":\"BlogPost\",\"action\":\"new\"} }'> </div> <!-- this would have two buttons, each configured in a way --> <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": [{ \"action\":\"edit\", \"useModuleList\":true, \"sortOrder\": 0, \"prefill\": { \"DocumentedOnPage\": \"page:@Dnn.Tab.TabID\", \"title\": \"@Dnn.Tab.Title\" } }, { \"action\" : \"new\", \"contentType\" : \"BlogPost\" }] }'> </div> What was Changed/Enhanced in 2sxc 9.40 There were some things which worked well, but bothered us as perfectionists :). It boils down to how much of the page html must be different just because editing is used. So this is what we wanted to change: the previous implementation always used a special class sc-element to mark the tag which detects mouse-over. This was necessary, because the tag itself was added in another place in the code. This is not necessary any more, since the sxc-toolbar attribute is now on the tag which does the hover-detect. the previous implementation created a <ul> tag in the source code. Though this was not a big issue, it just didn't feel right. the previous implementation spread the information for the toolbar on two attributes toolbar and settings - this just wasn't perfect. Now it's both in the sxc-toolbar attribute. How to Use before 2sxc 9.40 <!-- this is the default toolbar for content assigned to this module --> <ul class=\"sc-menu\" toolbar='{\"sortOrder\":0,\"useModuleList\":true,\"isPublished\":true}'></ul> <!-- this is a default toolbar for content-items not assigned to this module --> <ul class=\"sc-menu\" toolbar='{\"isPublished\":true,\"entityId\":6875}'></ul> <!-- this could be a custom toolbar for showing a new-button only --> <ul class=\"sc-menu\" toolbar='{\"contentType\":\"BlogPost\",\"action\":\"new\"}'></ul> <!-- this would have two buttons, each configured in a way --> <ul class='sc-menu' toolbar='[{ \"action\":\"edit\", \"useModuleList\":true, \"sortOrder\": 0, \"prefill\": { \"DocumentedOnPage\": \"page:@Dnn.Tab.TabID\", \"title\": \"@Dnn.Tab.Title\" } }, { \"action\" : \"new\", \"contentType\" : \"BlogPost\" }]'></ul> How it Works Internally, a lot will happen to actually turn that into a real, usually floating, toolbar. Basically what happens is a script picks up all cases of <* sxc-toolbar=...> and <ul class=\"sc-menu ...\"></ul> it will then pass it to a toolbar creator which will either create a standard-list of buttons, or a custom one the resulting buttons/links will be placed in <li> items and added to the <ul> tag But you could also do a whole lot more, including custom buttons and code (since 2sxc 08.06) <div sxc-toolbar='{ \"toolbar\": { \"groups\": [ { \"name\": \"my default list\", \"buttons\": \"edit,add,more\" }, { \"name\": \"list buttons\", \"buttons: \"sort,moveup,movedown,more\" }, { \"name\": \"really advanced stuff\", \"buttons\": [ \"app\", \"zone\", { \"command\":{ \"action\": \"custom\", \"customCode\": \"alert(&apos;hello&apos;)\" } \"icon\": \"icon-sxc-bomb\" }, \"more\" ] } ], \"defaults\": { \"entityId\": 740, \"contentType\": \"BlogPost\" } }}'> ... </div> All the configuration is in the sxc-toolbar attribute, which contains two main nodes: toolbar - see below settings - see Toolbar Settings In the old syntax (before 2sxc 9.40, using the <ul> tag, two attributes are handled toolbar or data-toolbar - see below settings or data-settings - see Toolbar Settings More Background The toolbar information is: an object with some properties (like entityId ) and no action verbs --> then it will auto-generate all default buttons { entityId: 17, isPublished: true } an object with some properties and 1 or more action verbs --> generate only these buttons { actions: \"new,edit\", useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 1 } an array with commands (objects with 1 verb) --> generate these Buttons [{ action: ...}, { action: ...}] on object containing a buton-group like { buttons: [ { command: { action: ...}}, { command: ...}] } a group of button-groups [ { buttons: ... }, {buttons: ...}] a full toolbar configuration { groups: [...], defaults: {...}, params: {...} } For a full scope of what is possible, you should read the js toolbar documentation .

How to use The most common use-case is actually to provide some HTML, which the JavaScript will pick up automatically and convert into a menu. You can read more about this in Html Toolbars and Buttons . You can also generate the html as needed - for example when working with a javascript template in AngularJS, React, Ember etc. Here's a small example: var btnHtml = $2sxc(740).manage.getButton({ action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\" }); var toolbarHtml = $2sxc(740).manage.getToolbar({ action: \"new,edit,add\", entityId: 203 }); So this is really it. There are only two commands you must know: ...getButton(...) ...getToolbar(...) The rest of the magic lies in the configuration objects which you pass into these buttons. So let's continue with that. A Deeper Look Inside the System The following terms help you understand what we're doing: 2sxc has many commands like new , edit etc. which you can run with parameters like: command = { action: 'new', contentType: 'BlogPost'}; a button will run such a command when clicked, but for it to work, the button must have the command ready, including the necessary parameters. In JavaScript a button is defined like: btn = { command: { action: \"...\", ...}, icon: \"...\", ... }; and will later be converted to HTML like <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run({\"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Dummy\"})'>new</a> a button group is an array of buttons, plus some shared specs like group = { buttons: [ { command: ...}, { }, { }], defaults: {...}, ... }; this will later be converted to a list of <li> nodes containing buttons a toolbar contains an array of button groups and again some shared specs / defaults, like toolbar = { groups: [ ... ], defaults: ...}; which will also be converted to the list of <li> nodes, but shows only one group at a time until the user presses a more button The full object tree of a toolbar is fairly sophisticated, and in most cases you can use shorthands which will be expanded internally before use. So you'll write // this is what you would normally write var toolbar = { action: \"new,edit,sort\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 2 }; // which internally expands to this: var toolbar = { groups: [{ buttons: [{ title: \"Toolbar.New\", command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\" }, icon: \"icon-sxc-plus\", addCondition: true, // more stuff here },{ title: \"Toolbar.Edit\", command: { action: \"edit\", useModuleList: true, sortOrder: 2 }, icon: \"icon-sxc-pencil\", addCondition: true, // more stuff here }, { // etc. }] }] } In most cases you just care about the shorthand. But in advanced cases where you really want to affect the behavior, you may go want to go deeper. Buttons and Commands Buttons are explained in more details here Commands which run when a button is pressed are here Custom commands which run your JS are here Button group This is just a simple object containing an array of buttons and some more settings which are rarely used and not documented yet. var group = { name: \"...\", buttons: \"...\", defaults: { // ... } }; var group2 = { buttons: [ { action: \"new\" }, { action: \"edit\", icon: \"icon-sxc-bomb\" }, \"button3\", { title: \"hello there\", command: { action: \"new\", } } ], defaults: { // todo } } Toolbar and Toolbar Configuration The toolbar can be defined very precisely, but in most cases you will opt for a short format which is expanded internally. Let's look at it: // very compact version var tb1 = { action: \"new,edit,moveup\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", entityId: 17 }; // array version var tb2 = [{ button1 }, { button2 }] // very expanded edition var tb2 = { groups: [ { name: \"group 1\", buttons: \"new,edit,more\" }, { name: \"group 2\", buttons: \"moveup,movedown,more\" } ], defaults: { contentType: \"BlogPost\", //... } }; Toolbar settings You can customize hover behavior , show behavior and more. Read about it in the toolbar settings . Custom Buttons with Custom Commands You can easily create custom buttons with custom icons, parameters and even custom scripts. It's not well documented yet, but it's best to just look through the tutorial app below.

    "title": "LookUp & LookUpEngine | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "LookUp & LookUpEngine Many things in the EAV and 2sxc require it to look up parameters. For example, when a Query is created, it may need to know the current PortalId or the current time, to properly filter/sort something. This is achieved through 2 special object types, the ToSic.Eav.LookUp .ILookUp and ToSic.Eav.LookUp .ILookUpEngine, both in the ToSic.Eav.LookUp namespace. LookUp Objects LookUp objects have a Name similar to a namespace or a scope. For example, when a Module is being rendered, there are LookUp objects with names like QueryString , Module , Portal etc. They also have a list of properties they can look up, like Id , PortalId or parameters from the url. The lookup object is then responsible to retrieve these if requested. Everything is lazy, so these objects are only accessed if the parameter is actually needed. All LookUp objects implement the ToSic.Eav.LookUp .ILookUp interface and should inherit the ToSic.Eav.LookUp .LookUpBase object. LookUpEngine LookUp Engines will collect a set of LookUp objects and use these to resolve strings like Module:ModuleId . For this, they will check which LookUp has the right name (in this case Module ) and will ask it if it can provide the value (in this case the ModuleId ). LookUp Engines all implement the ToSic.Eav.LookUp .ILookUpEngine interface and should inherit the ToSic.Eav.LookUp .LookUpEngine object. Note Usually LookUp Engines will receive a long list (Dictionary) of things to look up, and resolve these in one quick call. This is because often they are attached to a DataSource which requires many configuration values - so they will prepare the list of parameters, pass it to the LookUpEngine and then work with the results as needed. Tip LookUp Engines can also perform default-fallbacks - so if a LookUp source can't provide the answer needed, the engine may use a static value instead: [QueryString:PageSize||10] Tip LookUp Engines can also perform lookup-fallbacks if the source can't provide an answer. In this case it may ask another LookUp if it has the answer. This happens when the Token looks like this: [QueryString:PageSize||[App:Settings:PageSize]] LookUpEngine objects are provided with DepedencyInjection. The system that gets the currently valid LookUpEngine inherits the ToSic.Eav.LookUp .IGetEngine. Examples of LookUp Objects Just to give you an idea of the power of LookUp objects, here are some in use: ToSic.Eav.LookUp .LookUpInEntity - this resolves entity values. ToSic.Eav.LookUp .LookUpInNameValueCollection - this resolves from name/value lists like Dictionary or Request.QueryString objects ToSic.Eav.LookUp .LookUpInMetadata - will get values from Metadata of something ToSic.Eav.LookUp .LookUpInLookUps - will look up values in various attached LookUp objects LookUpInDnnPropertyAccess - will look up stuff in DNN specific PropertyAccess objects, which are similar to LookUp objects LookUpInDynamicEntity - will look up things in a IDynamicEntity and also provide more information like Count, IsFirst, etc. for the Token Engine Also Read DataSource Concept: Configuration Injection using Tokens Placeholder Tokens DataSource API: EnsureConfigurationIsLoaded ToSic.Eav.LookUp ToSic.Sxc.LookUp ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.LookUp History General Tokens introduced in 2sxc 1.0 Most enhancements were in 2sxc 07.00"

    "keywords": "Inner Content (Content Within Other Content) Inner Content is the feature to place content-blocks (apps or common content-items) inside another content-item. There are two common scenarios for this: Apps with list/details views, with a feature rich details-view . For example: a blog, which lets the editor add galleries and other apps into each blog-post. This is called a mashup app as it mixes apps together Apps which wrap other content/apps, for example an accordion-app which lets the editor add further content-blocks or apps into each collapsing segment. Basic Concept Inner Content links other content-blocks (apps, content) to a Content Item , allowing the template to then show this inner content where it wants to. An Item can have Many Sets of Inner-Content A template can have multiple sets of inner content. For example: a real-estate app showing a details-page with 2 columns, each containing an variety of content-items, different from house-item to house-item. One house could have a gallery-app in the first column, while the other house would have a 3D walkthrough app and preferr to use the gallery in the second column a Catalog app containing many WYSIWYG text blocks (ProductDescription, ShowCase, ApplicationSuggestions) shown in multiple tabs, each WYSIWYG containing apps inline between the paragraphs. To achieve this flexibility, the Inner Content items are linked not only to a Content Item but to a specific field in that item. So each set of related items is stored in one field, and by using multiple fields you can have multiple sets of items. This allows the template to handle each set separately. Standalone Inner-Content - like a DNN Pane just for this item A common use case is to provide the editor with an area into which he/she can add as many content-blocks/apps as they want to. This feels like a DNN-pane - the editor just adds apps as he needs them. This mode is common for mashup-apps and is mostly used on sophisticated details-pages with a clear area containing additional functionality. It's also common in layout-changing apps like the accordion app . In WYSIWYG Inner-Content this is new in 2sxc 8.9 Sometimes you may let the editor add inner-content blocks within a wysiwyg-field, so that normal written content can be interspersed with apps. This is common in news-style apps or blogs, where additional features are needed (galleries, code-snippets, etc.) but mixed with the main text and not in a separate area. Here is a blog tutorial on implementing Very Rich Text . The Parts that Make it Work For Inner Content to work, the following parts play together: Data storage : you need fields in your content-type to link to the external content blocks. Just create entity-fields and use the type Content Block Items . In many cases you also want to hide the field because it's not important to the content-editor. Just go to the field-settings and set Visible in Edit UI to off. Content-Block rendering in the templates, using the Razor API - it is prepared both for the standalone-area-mode as well as the merge-with-wysiwyg-mode. In-Page Editing : to allow the editor to add / edit content-blocks in the normal view, the UI must support it. This is handeled automatically by Quick-Edit . To do the in-page Editing, quickE needs to know some context information (what field to store the links in, etc.), provided in an HTML-attribute. It's either rendered in automatically when using the Razor commands or you can manually place them using [context attributes](xref:Razor.ContextAttributes]. If you want the WYSIWYG-integration the wysiwyg must know which field to use to manage the linked content-blocks. This is simply done by convention: as soon as a content-block field follows right after a wysiwyg-field, they will be linked and the button will appear. This also works it the content-block field is set to invisible.

    "keywords": "DataSource API DataSources are a magic, generic system which can generate new data-items or filter / modify other data. This section explains how they work and the API you need to create your own. Basics DataSources have a few important concepts you must first understand: An item is a data-object of the type IEntity - it can be a person, product, file-informatio etc. A list of items is is a List<IEntity> which contains zero, one or many items A stream is an object which has list of items, and a name A correctly built stream will offer this list, but only build it if it's actually requested Each DataSource has one or many named Out streams Each DataSource can have one or more named In streams coming from other DataSources Each DataSource has a ConfigurationProvider , which gives the DataSource information about the environment (like Portal or Tab information), App-Settings and more Each DataSource can have custom Settings , which the user entered in a dialog. Internally this is also an IEntity object DataSources also have cache-identity mechanism, to inform any up-stream cache what parameters actually caused this result, so that the data could be cached if needed Providing Data To offer data on the Out you will usually use the Provide method. If you're generating new items, you'll usually use the AsEntity method. Docs for these: DataSource.Provide DataSource.AsEntity Receiving Data from In for further processing if your DataSource performs filtering or similar actions on existing data, then this data comes in on the In streams. In such scenarios, you would simply iterate over the In[streamname].List and provide the result in your out-stream again. You can find many examples in the EAV DataSources code. Getting Configuration A DataSource gets the configuration from a configuration provider. To better understand this, you should read: about configuration about tokens ConfigMask(...) .

    "title": "DataSource Concept: Configuration Injection using Tokens | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "DataSource Concept: Configuration Injection using Tokens DataSource objects have an sophisticated system to retrieve settings and configuration using tokens and more. A DataSource is usually configurable, meaning that it needs parameters to do it's job. Some examples: a ModuleDataSource needs to know the module ID an Owner-Filter DataSource needs to know who the current user is, to find his items a Paging needs to know what page size it should use and what page it's on A CSV data source needs to know what file it should load As you can see, some of this information depends on the current context (ModuleId, UserId), others on configured settings (page size) and some on Url-parameters (Page number). In addition, we sometimes want to say \"use the page-size configured in the App-Settings\" or even more complex \"use from url, but if not specified, try app-settings, and if that isn't defined, use 10\" . This is what this Token-Configuration-Injection-System is for. Configuration Basics Each configuration of a DataSource is either a fixed string value like 17 or a token like [Settings:PageNumber] . In most cases it's a token. This token is parsed before any data is queried to ensure that in the end the DataSource has a usefull value before actually performing its task. Token Basics A token is a piece of text that looks like [Source:Property] . It is good to understand the full token concept, discussed here . You'll also want to read about fallback and recursion to understand the following content. Shared Token-Suppliers / Token-Sources When a DataSource is configured, it has many token-suppliers like Module , QueryString , App etc. These are shared and are identical for all objects. Advanced Token-Source for Settings The Settings source is a special source which contains all the properties of the settings-item which configures exactly this one data-source. For example the token [Settings:PageNumber] will deliver the number or text in the settings pagenumber field. Advanced Token-Source for In DataSources also have a source called In which is different for each DataSource, as each one has its own In-streams. You can use it in tokens like [In:Default:PageSize] where the term after In: is the stream-name to be consulted. How Tokens are Defined, Settings Edited and Resolved When you're using the visual query designer, the configuration created is saved as an Entity (aka Content-Item) which must be injected into the DataSource configuration automatically. But when you use the object is your code, your code must be able to provide other values. But how does this work? Each DataSource object has a property called Configuration which is a dictionary containing all configuration properties the data source will care about. For example, the EntityIdFilter has a Configuration with only one property which is called EntityIds . The each property is first initialized with a Token-Template. For example, the CsvDataSource has a ConfigMask(DelimiterKey, \"[Settings:Delimiter||\\t]\"); This says that the delimiter should come from the Settings-Entity field Delimiter and if not provided, fall back to \\t (which is a tab character) read about ConfigMask here For the programmer who wants to set a number or whatever, this would be fairly unreliable to access from outside, so the DataSource should also have a real property which internally also modifies the dictionary. For example, the CsvDataSource has a string-property Delimiter which internally will get/set the in the Configuration dictionary. When the DataSource is first sucked from, which happens when something tries to access the Out-Property, it will automatically run a token-engine to resolve the values, then run whatever action the data-source wants. read about ensuring configuration is parsed here So how does each scenario work out? If the programmer overwrote the Delimiter property, then internally the Configuration[\"Delimiter\"] is now not a token any more, but instead just a character like , . So the token-engine won't change anything. If the programmer didn't do anything but the visual query engine gave a settings-entity to the system, then the token is resolved and whatever the user entered is used. if the neither the programmer nor the user provided settings, then the token-engine will resolve to the fallback and use the \\t as was defined.

    "title": "Html & JS: Button Definitions | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "Html & JS: Button Definitions When you create custom buttons in a floating toolbar you can customize everything including the icon and more. This is explained here. Buttons are of html, basically a <a click=\"...\">[some-icon]</a> . When the button is created, it must already know what it's for, which is why the command must be prepared when the button is created. How to use A short example of a slightly customized button definition: var btns = [{ command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Category\" }, title: \"create Category\" }, { command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Author\" }, title: \"create Author\" }]; This simple example shows two new buttons creating different kinds of things, and we customized the label so the mouse-over would tell the editor which button is which. Let's get a bit more sophisticated var btn = { command: { // some command here }, icon: \"icon-sxc-code\", title: \"this is my special button\", classes: \"redButton\", }; The above example shows all than can currently be configured one a button. And here's a much more complex example. This is the full object-structure which the button generator getButton(...) understands: // full version var btn = { title: \"some title - ideally from translation table\", icon: \"some icon like icon-sxc-bomb\", command: { action: \"some action name like new\", moreParamsAsNeeded: \"...\" }, showCondition: someValueOr function(itemSettings) { return true; }, classes: \"btn-xyz my-class\", dynamicClasses: function(itemSettings) { if( (new Date()).getDay() === 1 ) return \"color-monday\"; } }; // typically more compact edition (will be expanded at runtime) var btn2 = { title: \"my button!\", icon: \"icon-sxc-list\", action: \"layout\" }; // or the totally compact edition var btn3 = \"layout\"; Some functioning code You may wonder how to actually use this. Here's an JSON example: <p class=\"sc-element\"> mouse over this to see inline-json version <ul class=\"sc-menu\" data-toolbar='[{ \"command\": { \"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Category\" }, \"title\": \"create Category\" }, { \"command\": { \"action\": \"new\", \"contentType\": \"Author\" }, \"title\": \"create Author\" }]'></ul> </p> Here's a more sophisticated (but also more reusable) example: <p class=\"sc-element\"> mouse over this to see the js toolbar generated by the buttons-list <toolbars2Buttons></toolbars2Buttons> </p> <script> var toolbars2Buttons = [{ command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Category\" }, title: \"create Category\" }, { command: { action: \"new\", contentType: \"Author\" }, title: \"create Author\" }]; // note that we cannot create the toolbars before the page-onready. Because of this // our code which creates the toolbar must be delayed, like in a $(our-code); $(function(){ if(typeof $2sxc != \"undefined\") // continue if $2sxc exists; it may be missing in non-edit modes $(\"toolbars2Buttons\").each(function(index, element){ var controller = $2sxc(element); if(!controller.isEditMode()) // check if this specific module currently allows editing return; var toolbar = controller.manage.getToolbar(toolbars2Buttons); $(element).replaceWith(toolbar); }); }); </script> How it works Buttons are used in toolbars all the time, and before they are rendered, the must be fully configured/expanded, as shown in the larger example. Internally the button is built with whatever is given, and anything not defined yet is automatically filled with the defaults. The defaults are taken from the commands definitions . Here's how the get defaults works: if all that is knows about a button is the name like var btn = \"new\" , then it gets all the configuration from the defaults if some properties are known, like var btn = { command: {action: \"new\"}, icon: \"myicon\" } , then only the missing properties are taken from the defaults. Note that retrieving defaults requires the button to know which command it's for, so the name of the command is essential. The Button Properties object command the internal command which will be called, should contain both the name and the parameters like { action: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\"} see also commands string icon a css class giving the button the icon. It can be one of the icons 2sxc provides, or it can be your own - just be sure to include a CSS & font which resolves the icon string title a text which is shown on mouse-over. Note that 2sxc will try to run it through the translator, so you can also use placeholders like Toolbar.Metadata string classes comma separated list of class-names like makeRed,glowHover function dynamicClasses(settings) can be used to dynamically build classes depending on the situation bool/function showCondition ( API still experimental ) - used to dynamically choose if this button should be shown or not bool disabled ( API still experimental ) would disable the click on a button bool partOfPage ( API still experimental , new in 2sxc 9.5 ) determines if resulting changes should effect the Evoq/DNN Page Publishing - note that it only effects the page-lifecyle, if the resulting dialogs and APIs respect this setting Some more Notes Because the button is often passed around as plain text/html, it can't rely on hidden variables to keep track of anything. This is why the onclick is so verbose, like onclick=\"$2sxc(4030).manage.run({\"action\": \"edit\", \"entityId\": 42 }) . This is to ensure it always survives the text-round-trip.

It's fairly advanced, so if you're new to 2sxc, best start with 2sxc.org . 2sxc - The CMS / CMF of DNN (DotNetNuke) 2sxc is a CMS-Plugin for DNN/DotNetNuke . It makes content editing easier than Wordpress. It's also a CMF like Drupal. And a very cool EAV data-management system. And an online REST JSON database. And a lot more. 2sxc is basically used to provide web-site-builder functionality to DNN, both in a simple Content mode (where users just add images, designed text/image blocks, links etc.) or in App mode, where user add standalone functional apps like blogs, galleries and more. Most apps are on github and can be downloaded from the app-catalog . Where to Start 2sxc is an easy to use dynamic content system for .net Platforms like DNN. If you are just getting started, then this is probably not where you should be looking. Focus first on: Content on 2sxc.org like the learn section Apps on 2sxc Catalog which contains many ready-to-use apps like blogs and news, as well as tutorials The DNN Tutorials on 2sxc.org With that knowledge, you can already create amazing stuff. Everything you find here is very advanced and you won't need it for normal everyday work. Overview and Links to Other Documentations 2sxc is very flexible and can be used for almost any kind of content-management needs or app development needs. Because of this, different documentations help you work with different things. Here's the overview: 2sxc.org Getting started tutorials are found in the Learn section of 2sxc.org includes installation, basic instructions, creating your first content-type and similar tutorials & it also include instructions how to export/import data, working with the image resizer and more. A list of features , concepts and examples can be found in the Docs section of 2sxc.org, including things not specifically code related Many solutions and recommendations are found in the Blog on 2sxc.org Many demo, template and tutorial Apps are found in the App Catalog on 2sxc.org 2sxc / EAV Roadmap APIs and similar are found in this wiki - you'll see the TOC in the box to the right App folder structure and special files Style Guide 2020 (beta) best-practices draft If you want to know more, then check out... The Specs which tells you about Architecture, Data Models and more The C# .net API Docs Documentation Version Generated for EAV/2sxc 10.27.01 Pending Work / Tasks Next to document Finish metadata documentation These topics are not or insufficiently documented...

    "keywords": "Debugging 2sxc using Insights 2sxc has powerfull debugging built in. We call it 2sxc Insights and it's available for both the Server and the JavaScript-UI and API. Since we're always a bit short on documentation resources, here's just the short version: Debugging Server Side Stuff using Insights Every module that is rendered and every api-call that is made is logged extensively. This is a life-saver both for finding issues in 2sxc, but also for find out where your settings went wrong. Since keeping these logs would clutter up memory, only 500 requests are stored, then logging is paused. As a super-user, you can always re-activate the recording for another 500 requests. Here are some blog posts which explain 2sxc Insights on the server Introducing 2sxc Insights The new enhanced awesome insights in 10.22 Debugging Client-Side JavaScripts, APIs or Custom Toolbars This was introduced in 2sxc 10.27. There are two things you need to know: Everything that 2sxc does internally is automatically logged. If you add ?debug=true to the url, the logging is intensified. To access the logs in the browser, open the console (F12) and type in $2sxc.insights() . You'll then be shown further commands you can type to narrow down which logs you want to see. Here's an example: It now lists what parts of 2sxc were logging activities. Let's assume you thing somethings wrong with your toolbar. Let's try $2sxc.insights('toolbar') : This shows you what toolbar structures were generated, and what the initial data was. Let's look at the #4 using $2sxc.insights('toolbar', 4) : As you can see there is now loads of information showing you what happened. This will help you see what structures are being built and where something went wrong - for example, why the color didn't make it from your settings to the final button. Tip The Insights are very extensive and best used while also looking at the code of 2sxc. History 2sxc Insights on the Server introduced in v9.31 Dramatically enhanced in v10.22 JavaScript Insights introduced in 10.27"

This would not be fun to use in razor, where you would prefer a simple @Something.Property syntax. This is where AsDynamic(...) comes in. How to Use If you have an IEntity or you're not sure if it's either an IEntity or a IDynamicEntity , just pass it through AsDynamic(...) and the result will be a IDynamicEntity . You can then access the properties with the simple thing.Property syntax. @inherits ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent @{ var unknown = App.Data[\"Default\"].List.First(); // this will be an IEntity var myThing = AsDynamic(unknown); } <div>@myThing.FirstName</div> Note Results of AsDynamic are dynamically typed, so you can write .Anything behind it. But the data coming out of it is strongly typed, so Content.Birthday is a real date object. Tip IDynamicEntity objects also have some additional properties like EntityId or Parents(...) . Check out the API docs. How it works AsDynamic has many signatures accepting a variety of input values. It then returns an dynamic object which is either a IDynamicEntity . These are the things AsDynamic can process: a IEntity - this will return a single IDynamicEntity IDynamicEntity - will return the same IDynamicEntity this option exists just so you don't have to pre-check what you pass in, making it easier to code for you a string containing JSON - will return a dynamic object DynamicJacket added in 2sxc 10.20.06 Tip To use the latest features of 2sxc 10.20+, make sure your razor file begins with the line @inherits ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent Otherwise your Razor templates is based on the default, older component code. Reversing AsDynamic with AsEntity There are rare cases where you have a IDynamicEntity and want to access the real underlying IEntity . For example if you want to really check in the code, what languages have been translated. This is very sophisticated, but you can always call AsEntity(...) with any IDynamicEntity to get a pure IEntity object. Obsolete use of AsDynamic() for Lists Warning In previous versions of 2sxc you'll find AsDynamic(...) also used to convert lists (IEnumerable or DataStreams) into lists. This caused a lot of issues with dynamic code compilation, so in 2sxc 10.20 we introduced AsList(...) for that use case. So if you find that kind of code, it works because... without @inherits ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent in the header, the old calls still work with @inherits ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.RazorComponent in the header, you must use AsList(...)

This is where it resides - usually you don't want to know about it ;). If you do, here a short conceptual background: Any object can have a property - usually called Log which is an ILog . Using this the object can call the Log.Add(...) to add messages. Many other commands help in various scenarios. The real power comes from chaining these - because each logger can know what parent-logger it reports to. This allows us to reproduce the chain of events in the original code, because you can track where loggers were made, and how they relate. The really amazing bit (added in 2sxc 10.22/10.23) is that the logger will also pick up the class names, code-file names and line of code where it was logged 😎. Most objects which use the Log, implement the IHasLog , often by inheriting ToSic.Eav.Logging .HasLog which automates things when initializing - like the chaining of the Loggers. Classes CodeRef Reference to code - containing the path to the file, the method name and the line in the code. HasLog Base class for most objects which simply want to implement log and log-chaining. Interfaces IHasLog Objects which can log their activity, and share their log with other objects in the chain to produce extensive internal logging. ILog A logger with special capabilities.

    "keywords": "How to Use a Dynamic Entity Whenever you create a content-type - like Person - and want to work with the data in your C# Razor templates, you'll be working with a Dynamic Entity . Tip Also read about AsDynamic(...) - Magic Objects Code example using a Dynamic Entity We'll assume we have a Content Type called Book with the following properties: Title (text, 1-line) Teaser (text, multi-line) Description (text, html) ReleaseDate (date) Author (entity - another content item) Here's a code example in a C# Razor template: <!-- The default variable for the current item is Content, we'll just use another name for this sample note that .Title is automatically provided, because the content-type has the property title. --> <h1>@Content.Title</h1> <div>@Content.Description</div> <div>Author: @Content.Author[0].FullName</div> So basically all properties of this book can be shown using [Object].[PropertyName] - for example Content.ReleaseDate . What Dynamic Entity really does - and how... Technically the dynamic entity object is like a read-helper for the more complex IEntity . So actually the dynamic entity object will keep a reference to the underlying read-only IEntity item on a property Entity , and whenever your code accesses a property, the dynamic entity will query it from the underlying Entity . The main things that the dynamic entity does for you, are Give you a nice, short syntax to access a property - so Content.FirstName instead of Object.Attributes[\"FirstName\"][\"en\"] which would be necessary using the more advanced IEntity object Ensure that the language used in retrieving a value is the current user language Give conveniant access to related information like the Presentation object Automatically handle some data-not-found errors Automatically do conversions, like convert related entities (like .Children ) into dynamic objects to make your code more consistant Properties of a Dynamic Entity Read the API docs in the IDynamicEntity . Additional properties that work (they are dynamic, so don't appear in the code) EntityType string - the type name like Person IsPublished bool - true/false if this item is currently published AnyProperty dynamic, but actually bool | string | decimal | datetime | List any normal property of the content-item can be accessd directly. It's correctly .net typed (string, etc.) Tip In 2sxc 10.27 any property that returns a List<DynamicEntity> now returns a DynamicEntityWithList . This means that if you expect the list to just return one item, you can directly access its properties like this: Content.Author.FirstName . To otherwise enumerate the items, we recommend AsList(Object) so AsList(Content.Tags) Working with unpublished/draft items TODO: write something about how-to-check if published/unpublished, navigating it, etc. - or link to such a page Appendix The following properties/methods exist, but shouldn't be used. They are documented here so that you know that they are not meant for public use: Created - the created date Author - the person who created this item Owner - the current owner of the item, usually the author Metadadata - currently use AsEntity(theObject).Metadata Permissions - permissions of the current item (if any are defined) History Introduced in 2sxc 01.00 Changed to use interface IDynamicEntity in 6.x Draft/Published introduced in 2sxc 7.x Presentation introduced in 2sxc 7.x Modified introduced in 2sxc 8.x Implemented .net equality comparer in 2sxc 9.42 Parents added in 2sxc 9.42 Get added in 2sxc 9.42 and added to interface IDynamicEntity in 10.07 Parents introduced in 2sxc 9.42, and added to interface IDynamicEntity in 10.07 IsDemoItem property added in 2sxc 10.06 Changed dynamic access to a property to return a DynamicEntity which is enumerable in 10.27"

When using content-items in Razor-Templates and WebAPIs you usually don't care about this, as you will use it as a [IDynamicEntity][Dynamic Entity]. But there are some advanced cases where you need to look deeper into the object - maybe to check if a translation exists in another language, or if the value is blank because it's null, or an empty string. In this case you'll need to look at the internals, the IEntity . Difference IEntity and IDynamicEntity Just a short piece of code, so you can see why you usually don't want to use the IEntity and will prefer the IDynamicEntity instead. // the common way, using the content-item as a DynamicEntity var titleSimple = Content.Title; // a bit harder, what actually happens internally var languagePreference = [\"de\", \"en\"]; var autoResolveLinks = true; var titleMedium = AsEntity(Content).GetBestValue(\"Title\", languagePreference, autoResolveLinks); // hard-core, the internals IEntity entity = AsEntity(Content); Dictionary<string, IAttribute> attribs = entity.Attributes; IAttribute titleMultiLanguage = attribs[\"Title\"]; string attType = titleMultiLanguage.Type; IEnumerable<IValue> titleVals = titleMultiLanguage.Values; IValue firstTitle = titleVals.First(); string firstString = firstTitle.ToString(); IEnumerable<ILanguage> langAssignments = firstTitle.Languages; //etc. As you can see, the internals provide a lot of information about the underlying data - things you usually don't care about, but in rare cases may be important. How to use Note that this is a very advanced topic, and you'll need Visual Studio Intellisense to get this done reasonably. Since you'll figure it out fairly quickly, we won't document it in detail here. What you need to know is: // assume that you have a DynamicEntity like Content var entity = AsEntity(Content); // assume that you have a DataStream with Entities... @foreach(var postEntity in Data[\"Default\"]) { var postDyn = AsDynamic(postEntity); // postEntity is a IEntity // postDyn is a DynamicEntity } // but this is easier - convert the whole list @foreach(var post in AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"])) { var postEnt = AsEntity(post); // do something with the @post here, it's a DynamicEntity // ...or with postEnt, it's an IEntity } Read also To dive deeper, you must check the EAV Server Code History Introduced in 2sxc 01.00 Multi-Language since 2sxc 02.00 Added Value and Value<T> , PrimaryValue<T> as well as Parents() and Children(...) in 09.42.

    "keywords": "App / @App object in Razor The App object gives you full access to everything you need to know about the current App, including Path-info, access to all Data this App has, access to Settings and language Resources and more. How to use Here's are two simple examples taken from the Blog App : <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"@App.Path/assets/style.css\" data-enableoptimizations=\"true\"/> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"@App.Path/assets/scripts.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"true\"></script> @foreach(var tag in AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Tag\"])) { <li class='@(\"app-blog-tag\" + tag.ManualWeight)'><a href=\"@App.Settings.DetailsPage/tag/@tag.Tag\" title=\"@tag.Name\">@tag.Name</a></li> } The <link... and <script... use the app-path to ensure that the file is correctly loaded, no matter what portal or app-name is currently valid. Here you can discover more about the optimizations . The loop iterates through all tags with the @foreach(var tag in AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Tag\"])) , creates <li> items and links these to a page defined in the App.Settings . How it works Whenever a 2sxc-instance is created to render a page or to deliver JSON data, the App object is created and prepared to deliver everything you need. It's very performant, because it doesn't actually get any data or run any queries unless these are accessed. App Properties The app-object uses the IApp interface ( see code ) has the following simple properties: AppId number, current App id AppGuid guid, internal use global id Configuration DynamicEntity , contains the configuration content-item Data IAppData, to access all App-data (see below) Folder string, storage folder name in portal/#/2sxc/... Hidden bool, info if the app cannot be selected in the UIs Name string, the app name Path string, the path as used in URLs in html PhysicalPath string, the path as used on the server C:... Query[\"QueryName\"] dictionary of queries (see below) Resources DynamicEntity , all the multi-language labels etc. (see below) Settings DynamicEntity , all the app-settings (see below) ZoneId number, current Zone ID (similar to PortalId) Using App Data (App.Data) The App object gives you immediate acccess to all data in the app, through the Data property. Basically you can use it as follows: Get All Data Items of a Content Type App.Data[\"ContentTypeName\"] will give you a stream of all entities of that type. In most cases you'll use an AsDynamic(...) to use it efficiently in loops etc. because most of the razor templating will prefer a DynamicEntity to a pure IEntity-object. Here's an example: @foreach(var post in AsDynamic(App.Data[\"BlogPost\"])) { @RenderPage(\"_list-item.cshtml\", new { Post = post }) } note : this will give you all items, but you'll have to sort it using LINQ or other mechanisms. If you're not familiar with that, you're better of using App.Query[...] (see below). Edit App Data Content-Items In addition to giving access to all entities in this app, you can also create, edit and delete items using the App.Data object. The commands provided are: App.Data.Create(contentTypeName, values, userName) App.Data.Update(entityId, values, userName) App.Data.Delete(entityId, userName) You can read more about this in the App Data API Feature Using App Queries (App.Query) The queries you create in the app-configuration dialogs can do many things like filter certain items, order them and more. You will often just connect them to a template and visualize the result, by you can also use it in your code. Here's how: @foreach(var tag in AsDynamic(App.Query[\"SortedTags\"][\"Default\"])) { <li class='@(\"app-blog-tag\" + tag.ManualWeight)'><a href='@Link.To(\"tag= \" tag.Tag)' title=\"@tag.Name\">@tag.Name</a></li> } Technically the App.Query is a IDictionary<string, IDataSource> , meaning that it's a dictionary using string identifiers (names), returning an IDataSource object. It's important to realize that a DataSource can deliver multiple streams of data - a bit like delivering multiple tables. Each stream has a name, and you must specify which stream you want to work with. In the above example, we're using the Default stream as defined with App.Query[\"SortedTags\"][\"Default\"] . Note about Unpublished / Draft Content-Items In case you're not aware of the draft/unpublished features in 2sxc, we want to note that each item can be live/draft, and each item could have a corresponding counterpart. So a draft-item could have a live-item (but doesn't have to), and a live-item could have a draft item. This is important, because the admin/editor will see all the draft items, while the end-user will only see the live ones. So the exact items shown and the item-count can differ if you are logged in. App Settings and Resources In the App dialogs you can manage Settings and Resources . Basically both are a content-item with the fields you specify, the only difference is the purpose they have. You should put button-labels, standard-texts, decorative images etc. into Resources and these will often change from language to language. You should put settings like \"what page is xxx on\" or \"the primary color is #53aaff\" into Settings You would normally use it like this: <h1 class='@App.Settings.HeadingsDecorators'> @Content.Title </h1> <div> @Content.Body </div> <a href=\"@App.Settings.DisclaimerPage\"> @App.Resources.Disclaimer </a> As you can see, the HeadingsDecorators or DisclaimerPage are best placed in the Settings , while the label of the Disclaimer link are best handled as a multi-language Resource . Read also If you need to get an App object for other apps, read External App Use If you want to use the App object from non 2sxc-code, like other MVC pages, check out External App Use Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App Blog App showing many such features More links: App Data Create/Update/Delete History Introduced in 2sxc 05.05 Stable since 2sxc 06.00 Data-API was introduced in 2sxc 06.05"

In most cases, a DNN-Module will show a 2sxc-template, and the content-editor will manually add items to it using the normal web-UI. In this case, these items will be tied to this use-case and 2sxc will deliver them in the Data object. In other cases, the template (or view) will be configured to get data from a query configered elsewhere. In this case, all data retrieved in the query will be provided in the same Data object. There are also cases, where a template needs both queried data (like all categories ) as well as content-items added manually. There are multiple easy ways of doing this todo - document later Note: if you want all data of a type, like \"Get me all Tag-items in the system\" you need to use App-Data . Most common way to use the Data object In all Razor-templates and also the web-api files, the Data object is already created and ready to access. Here's a code example: <div class=\"app-blog\"> @foreach(var post in AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"])) { // do something with the @post here } </div> the foreach will loop through all items of the data in the Stream Default - read more about streams below the var post is the inner variable containing the current item the AsDynamic will ensure that the items we're working with are easy to code with, because they are Dynamic Entities The Streams in a Data Object The data object can have multiple Streams , each containing a list of items. In most cases you'll just have the Default stream, which you can access using Data[\"Default\"] . Read more about streams in the Stream docs But you may also have additional streams, depending on what has been configured in the data-preparation stuff (usually a visual query). For example, if you are working on a view showing one product and a menu with all possible categories, then your query may have these streams: Book (the current book, this stream has 1 item with the ID matching the ID in the URL) Categories (all categories in the system, sorted A-Z) The code would then look a bit like this: var book = Data[\"Book\"].FirstOrDefault(); // returns an IEntity Object var cats = Data[\"Categories\"]; // returns an IEnumerable of iEntity objects Or in most cases, because of the simpler syntax later on: var book = AsDynamic(Data[\"Book\"].FirstOrDefault()); // returns one dynamic entity var cats = AsDynamic(Data[\"Categories\"]); // returns an IEnumerable of dynamic entities Changing what is provided by Data The main configuration of the template will determine, what data is initially provided to the template. Afterwards, other mechanisms can override / change this. Initial Sources Default type/list configuration - this can determine that 0, 1 or many items (of a certain type) are delivered if one or many are delivered, then the selection will be based on what the editor added to the module instance. Visual Query - if the template has a query attached, this query will deliver the data Modifications to the source for the template The event CustomizeData can optionally completely reconfigure what Data contains in your code. Data Object API The Data object itself is actually a normal EAV IDataSource . So if you need to know more about the internals, read it up there. All other properties of the Data object are very special use only, so you probably shouldn't bother about them - which is why they are not documented here."

    "keywords": "Link / @Link Object in Razor / .net Basically you can always link around to other pages, websites or views using normal <a href=\"...\">text</a> html. And often you just want to add some parameters to the current Url like ?id=27 - but the behavior of this can be very different depending on the DNN settings. The Link object helps you handle this. Note: DNN often has a problem with links, because depending on what page you are on, the behaviour is a bit different. This is especially important on the home page. Use @Link.To(...) to make sure everything works no matter what. How to use Here's a quick example of using the Link object in a Razor template: <a href=\"@Link.To(parameters: \"id=\" + item.EntityId)\"> @item.Title </a> This example creates a link to the current page, adding either ?id=27 or /id/27 , depending on the DNN configuration. How it works The Link -object is always available in all Razor-templates. Internally it uses the DNN API to get the correct url. Using @Link.To() Example: @Link.To(parameters: \"id=17\") @Link.To(parameters: \"id=403&category=all\") Using @Link.Base() for JavaScript SPA modules This is new in 2sxc v9.5.1. It ensures that the url can be used for SPAs, as some pages will otherwise provide a wrong link (like home) which then breaks the SPA. <base href=\"@Link.Base()\"> Notes and Clarifications The Link-Object is of type ILinkHelper . Enforced Parameter Naming To promote long term API stability, we require all parameters to be named when used. This allows us to add further parameters later on, and the calls will still work. <!-- this will work --> @Link.To(parameters: \"id=17\") @Link.To(parameters: \"id=403&category=all\") <!-- new in 2sxc 9.5.1 --> @Link.To(pageId: 40, parameters: \"id=403&category=all\") <!-- this won't work --> @Link.To(\"id=17\") Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App Blog App History Introduced in 2sxc 8.4 Enhanced in 2sxc 9.5.1 with Base() and with parameter pageId on Link.To"

This means that a command like this is valid <div @Edit.TagToolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\")> ... </div> ...and this is not <div @Edit.TagToolbar(\"new\", \"BlogPost\")> ... </div> Reason Behind Named Parameters We often have APIs which start simple - like @Edit.TagToolbar() and continue to receive new features. At first, the parameter order will make sense - for that simple use case. But as the API grows, the parameter-order will become strange, simply because we would have to order them in the sequence they were added (to keep compatibility) and not in the order that makes sense. By using named parameters, we're making sure that the parameter order never matters and the API stays stable/compatible for the future. Not all Parameters Require Names Because of historic reasons and because some APIs simply have a very obvious first or second parameter, it may be that the first 1-2 parameters are not named. An example is @Edit.TagToolbar(Content) which assumes that the first parameter without name is the item (entity) for which this toolbar is meant. How It's Implemented Internally the real signature of the command uses a parameter which has a fairly random value. The call then checks if the value of that parameter is this random value, and if not, shows an error. This is to protect you from accidentally using the command without naming the parameters. Note: you could of course work around this, by providing that random value and trick the call to accept unnamed parameters. Don't do this - as we will no guarantee that the API signature (parameter order) will stay the same. History Introduced ca. in 2sxc 6"

It usually means that you have code using DynamicEntity which had to be moved to another namespace for consistency. We're sorry about the breaking change. From what we see it mainly affects the very old FAQ app which had some very old coding style in it for LINQ. In this case it was not possible to clean 2sxc and still ensure that this works, because of type-casting restrictions in C# related to covariance and contravariance . Background: DynamicEntity was moved To create the public documentation we had to make sure our API was consistent, and IEntity was one of the exceptions. Before 2sxc 10.20 it was in the namespace ToSic.SexyContent . We standardized it now to ToSic.Sxc.Data so the full name is ToSic.Sxc.Data.DynamicEntity . Quick Fix: Change the namespace Your code probably has a @using ToSic.SexyContent . You should change this to @using ToSic.Sxc.Data; And everything should work. But please also check the good fix below: Good Fix: Change to <dynamic> Razor code shouldn't actually need to know the type of this dynamic entity. So it's better to replace occurances of DynamicEntity with the appropriate dynamic . For example, replace List<DynamicEntity> with IEnumerable<dynamic> (note that List<dynamic> won't work because of covariance restrictions). In the example of the FAQ app, it's recommended you change line 23 <li class=\"sc-element faq-set\" data-tags=\"@String.Join(\",\", ((List<DynamicEntity>)q.Categories).Select(a => AsDynamic(a).EntityId))\"> to <li class=\"sc-element faq-set\" data-tags=\"@String.Join(\",\", (q.Categories as IEnumerable<dynamic>) .Select(a => AsDynamic(a).EntityId))\"> To better understand this, best consult the LINQ Tutorials Full Error Example A full error can look like this: Error: System.Web.HttpCompileException (0x80004005): ...\\Portals\\...\\2sxc\\FAQ with Categories\\_All questions (sorted) of a selected category.cshtml(23): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'DynamicEntity' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) at System.Web.Compilation.AssemblyBuilder.Compile() at System.Web.Compilation.BuildProvidersCompiler.PerformBuild() at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.CompileWebFile(VirtualPath virtualPath) at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.GetVPathBuildResultInternal(VirtualPath virtualPath, Boolean noBuild, Boolean allowCrossApp, Boolean allowBuildInPrecompile, Boolean throwIfNotFound, Boolean ensureIsUpToDate) at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.GetVPathBuildResultWithNoAssert(HttpContext context, VirtualPath virtualPath, Boolean noBuild, Boolean allowCrossApp, Boolean allowBuildInPrecompile, Boolean throwIfNotFound, Boolean ensureIsUpToDate) at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.GetVirtualPathObjectFactory(VirtualPath virtualPath, HttpContext context, Boolean allowCrossApp, Boolean throwIfNotFound) at System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.GetCompiledType(VirtualPath virtualPath) at ToSic.Sxc.Engines.RazorEngine.CreateWebPageInstance() in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\2Sexy Content Razor\\Engines\\Razor\\RazorEngine.cs:line 107 at ToSic.Sxc.Engines.RazorEngine.InitWebpage() in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\2Sexy Content Razor\\Engines\\Razor\\RazorEngine.cs:line 128 at ToSic.Sxc.Engines.RazorEngine.Init() in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\2Sexy Content Razor\\Engines\\Razor\\RazorEngine.cs:line 43 at ToSic.Sxc.Engines.EngineBase.Init(ICmsBlock cmsBlock, Purpose purpose, ILog parentLog) in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\ToSic.Sxc\\Engines\\EngineBase.cs:line 76 at ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.CmsBlock.GetRenderingEngine(Purpose renderingPurpose) in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\ToSic.Sxc\\Blocks\\CmsBlock_Render.cs:line 122 at ToSic.Sxc.Blocks.CmsBlock.Render() in C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website\\DesktopModules\\ToSIC_SexyContent\\ToSic.Sxc\\Blocks\\CmsBlock_Render.cs:line 56 Here's a print-screen:"

Example: Basic filter of a list by string var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); items = items.Where(p => p.Name == \"Chuck Norris\"); // items now contains only items which have \"Chuck Norris\" as name property Any Returns true if any of the elements matches a criteria. var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); var containsChuckNorris = items.Any(p => p.Name == \"Chuck Norris\"); // if containsChuckNorris is true, at least one element has name \"Chuck Norris\" Here's another Any - to see if a relationship contains something. It's a bit more complex, because Razor needs to know what it's working with: // filter - keep only those that have this Category // note that the compare must run on the EntityId because of object wrapping/unwrapping postsToShow = postsToShow .Where(p => (p.Categories as List<dynamic>) .Any(c => c.EntityId == ListContent.Category[0].EntityId)) OrderBy / OrderByDescending Order a list (IEnumerable) by a specific field. var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); items = items.OrderBy(p => p.Name); // items are now ordered by property \"Name\" First / Last Get first or last element of the list. var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); var first = items.First(); // contains the first element var last = items.Last(); // contains the last element Select Transform list into a new list, selecting only specified field(s). var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); var names = items.Select(p => p.Name); // names is a list of all names Take / Skip Paging functions: Take only n elements, skip m elements var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); items = items.Skip(10).Take(10); // Skips the first 10 elements and select only 10 Count Count number of elements in a list. var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); var count = items.Count(); // contains the number of elements in the list IndexOf Find index of a specific element in the list. @{ var items = AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]); } @foreach(var item in items) { <h1>Item number @items.IndexOf(item)</h1> }"

When using Razor or working in WebApi, this is best done with LINQ. This guide will assist you to get everything working. For a more API-oriented documentation, see DotNet Query LINQ . We also recommend to play around with the Razor Tutorial App LINQ Basics The way LINQ works is that the namespace System.Linq contains a bunch of extension methods like .Count() , .Where(...) and more. So to use LINQ you need to add a @using statement to razor or just using in a WebApi class. Here's a simple razor example: @using System.Linq; @{ var newestPosts = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"BlogPost\"]) .OrderByDescending(b => b.PublicationDate) .Take(3); } This demonstrates: adding the using statement getting all the BlogPost items using App.Data[\"BlogPost\"] converting it to a list of dynamic objects which will allow the nice syntax using AsDynamic(...) sorting these with newest on top using .OrderByDescending(...) on the property PublicationDate keeping only the first 3 using .Take(3) it also shows how placing the parts on separate lines makes the code easier to read Important: Working with LINQ and dynamic objects LINQ needs IEnumerable<...> Before we continue, it's important that you really understand that LINQ commands are stored as extension methods of IEnumerable<T> . So this works: @using System.Linq; @{ var list = new List<string> { \"word\", \"word\" }; var x = list.First(); } ...whereas this does not: @using System.Linq; @{ var y = 27.First(); } This sounds obvious, but there's an important catch: if the compiler doesn't know that something is an IEnumerable , it will not even try to use the LINQ extension methods, because it doesn't know that it can. So let's look at that... LINQs Problems with dynamic objects #1 Here's an example that would fail: @using System.Linq; @{ dynamic list = new List<string> { \"word\", \"word\" }; var x = list.First(); } The only difference to before is that list ist now dynamic . It contains the same object, but the compiler doesn't treat it that way. In Razor, we use dynamic objects all the time, where we run into this problem. Here's an example which fails: @using System.Linq; @{ var books = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithoutAuthors = books .Where(b => !b.Authors.Any()); } Internally the b.Authors returns a list of authors, but the compiler doesn't know this, since it's treated as a dynamic object. You would get an error. To solve this, we must tell the compiler that b.Authors is an IEnumerable, like this: @using System.Linq; @using System.Collections.Generic; @{ var books = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithoutAuthors = books .Where(b => !(b.Authors as IEnumerable<dynamic>).Any()); } But let's be honest - it's ugly, long and prone to typos. Especially in a complex query where you could have many of these. So we recommend to define a shorthand for it, like this: @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; @{ var books = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithoutAuthors = books .Where(b => !(b.Authors as Dynlist).Any()); } LINQs problem with dynamic objects #2 LINQ methods often have multiple signatures. This means the same command can be written in different ways and with different parameters. To detect the right method, the compiler needs to know the data-types used in the parameters. This causes problem with dynamic objects because the compiler doesn't know what it is until runtime. Check this out: @using System.Linq; @{ var dogString = \"dog\" dynamic dogDyn = \"dog\"; var list = new List<string> { \"dog\", \"cat\", \"hound\" }; var x = list.Contains(dogString); // this works var x = list.Contains(dogDyn); // this fails } To fix this, we must tell the compiler it's an object: @using System.Linq; @{ dynamic dynDog = \"dog\"; var list = new List<string> { \"dog\", \"cat\", \"hound\" }; var x = list.Contains(dynDog as object); } The above example is a bit trivial but here's a real life example, taken from the 2sxc razor tutorial : @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; @{ var persons = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Persons\"]); var books = AsDynamic(App.Data[\"Books\"]); var booksWithAwardedAuthors = books .Where(b => (b.Authors as Dynlist) .SelectMany(a => a.Awards as Dynlist) .Any() ); var otherBooks = books .Where(b => !(booksWithAwardedAuthors as Dynlist) .Contains(b as object) ); } LINQs problem with dynamic object #3 The last bit has to do with how dynamic objects are built, since they are usually wrapper-objects to help write nicer template code. As wrappers, they are different objects every time. This shows the problem: @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; @{ // this is just the data object, \"@bookData.Author\" wouldn't work var bookData1 = App.Data[\"Books\"].First(); var bookData2 = App.Data[\"Books\"].First(); // this is now a dynamic object, allowing @bookDyn1.Author\" var bookDyn1 = AsDynamic(bookData1); var bookDyn2 = AsDynamic(bookData2); var dataIsSame = bookData1 == bookData2; // true var dynIsSame = bookDyn1 == bookDyn2; // false before 2sxc 9.42 } This doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is. Look at this code from the example above: var otherBooks = books .Where(b => !(booksWithAwardedAuthors as Dynlist) .Contains(b as object) ); The .Contains(...) clause receives a variable b which is actually the dynamic wrapper, and will not be the same as the dynamic wrapper of dynamic wrappers given in booksWithAwardedAuthors . So contains would always say \"nope, didn't find it\". Solving the comparison / equality problem requires the underlying wrapper object to tell the .net framework, that == , != and a few internal methods must work differently. 2sxc 9.42 does this, so the above code would actually work in 2sxc 9.42, but not in previous versions. If another system gives you dynamic objects, you will probably have to write it like this: // this example is for non-2sxc objects or 2sxc before 9.42 var otherBooks = books .Where(b => !(booksWithAwardedAuthors as Dynlist) .Contains(bookWithAward => bookWithAward != null && bookWithAward.SomeProperty == b.SomeProperty) ); LINQs problem with boolean null-objects In many cases, dynamic objects could have a property like Show which could be a boolean, but it could also be null . So this could cause an error: var show = links.Where(x => x.Show); To fix this, the easiest way is to really compare it with true or false as you want, each way will result in treating the null as the opposite (so you decide if null should be yes or no): @using System.Linq; @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; Dynlist list; list = links.Where(x => x.Show == true); // take true, skip false & null list = links.Where(x => x.Show != true); // take false & null, skip true list = links.Where(x => x.Show == false); // take false, skip true & null list = links.Where(x => x.Show != false); // take true & null, skip false list = links.Where(x => x.Show == null); // take null, skip true & false Read also, Demo App and further links LINQ API Docs Razor Tutorial App showing all kinds of Queries History Guide created 2019-03"

Pre-Requisites Visual Studio 2015 MSBuild Community Tasks 1.4 or newer (required for automatic module packaging if you want to create dnn-module packages of 2sxc to distribute to another dnn) https://github.com/loresoft/msbuildtasks or chec https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=19372 We also use grunt, gulp and bower so if you want to do some JS you'll also need to install NPM, Gulp and Bower (grunt will auto-install as a dependency) Recommendations: SQL Server 2014, but it also works on older versions like 2008 Basics The full solution pulls together many projects, some responsible for server-code, some for UI, some for in-page JS and some just containing translations. We separated these to make it easier to contribute to a specific part without worrying about the rest. If you only want to contribute to something small - like the languages / translations - then you only need to download that repository. In the complex scenarios each project can build into the other target, so if you want to work full-stack and use all of the automation, you will want to put everything in C:\\Projects\\ . Example when helping with translations The github repo for translations is https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-eav-languages with the command line, go to C:\\Projects\\ (of course you may want to create that folder first) clone the github repo with git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-eav-languages - this will create a folder for you called C:\\Projects\\2sxc-eav-languages containing all the languages work in that project commit back Note: as you probably won't have write permissions on the main language repo, you probably can't commit back. The correct procedure then is to fork the main repo into yours, and push into your own online repo. Then start a pull request, which we can then process. Full Scale Setup The full-scale setup is meant for people, who want to work with all the pieces. As of now (December 2017) you should clone all these projects into the following folders: Start by Installing your DNN Installing DNN Please install a DNN - ideally a 7.4.2 version or similar so you wont use APIs which don't exist in that version in the path above. Steps are approx. like this: Recommended: using NVQuickSite you can easily install DNN 7.4.2 in the C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website folder. This exact folder is important, because other parts (like js projects) will copy their builds into this folder The domain isn't important, but we recommend 2sxc-dnn742.dnndev.me Manual: Download the minimal DNN version that 2sxc supports and extract it to C:\\Projects\\2sxc-dnn742\\Website (the exact folder is important, because the grunt/gulp tasks refer to this path) Configure the website in IIS (use binding 2sxc.dev) Use a default ASP.NET 4 / 4.5 application pool with Network Service account Add entry to local hosts file: 127.0.0.1 2sxc-dnn742.dnndev.me (could also be different, but this is our recommendation) Setup an empty database in SQL Management Studio Start the website and configure DNN to use the previously created database Installing 2sxc as Code in the DNN Then install 2sxc as a normal installable module (to get all the tables etc. setup) Now you must replace the installed 2sxc with the source-code version, linked to Github. /DesktopModules/ToSIC_SexyContent folder again (required because we clone the git repository there) Use Visual Studio, Git or SourceTree to clone the 2sxc repository at https://github.com/2sic/2sxc to the empty folder ToSIC_SexyContent - eg. in /DesktopModules/ type git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc ToSic_SexyContent also run bower install and npm install in the folder (using command-line or visual studio) Note: don't open the 2sxc-solution yet in visual studio - you need to later open the full package which includes the EAV with 2sxc, otherwise project references get \"fixed\" in a wrong way Installing the additional git repositories in a command line, go to c:\\Projects\\ run git clone https://github.com/2sic/eav-server - the EAV server system run git clone https://github.com/2sic/eav-ui - the EAV UI (javascript dialogs, etc.) run git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-ui - the 2sxc / DNN UIs run git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-eav-languages - the languages run git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-icons - our custom icon-fonts for all of these you may need to run npm install and/or bower install GIT Branches We use the git-flow convention , and you should familiarize yourself with this, to properly work with the branches. As of now, the development-branch is called dev but we'll rename it to develop within the next few days. The EAV / 2sxc Server Solution Basically if you open the solution in the eav-server folder, it will open all the EAV server (C#) code and 2sxc code in Visual Studio. This is very important, because if you build anything extensive and rename anything, it guarantees that everything is correctly updated. The EAV-UI This is a lot of JS, which when you build it using gulp develop , it will collect / build it all, and auto-copy to the 2sxc-folders. The 2sxc UI This extends the EAV-UI with more field types, adds configuration and also adds a lot of other JS. if you run the gulp develop it too will auto-build and copy to the live DNN / 2sxc site. The Importance of the right Folders The current setup places the EAV project and the 2sxc-project in exactly defined folders. This helps that when we build the EAV or make changes to it, that it will auto-copy everything in the build-process to the 2sxc bin and dist. So this isn't required, but if you want to do some serious stuff it will save you time to copy/deploy the dependencies over and over. The 2sxc dnn should run in c:\\projects\\2SexyContent\\Web WIP (Work In Progress) At the moment not important yet, but some new features we're working on are in these Repos: git clone https://github.com/2sic/2sxc-inpage git clone https://github.com/2sic/eav-item-dialog-angular"

    "keywords": "How to contribute to this documentation This documentation is a wiki, stored in a github repository. This means that Edit online You can edit the documentation online directly if you want to - this is ideal for new pages, small changes, correction etc. All you need is a valid github account, and you're ready to go. Just use the edit-button on every page. Edit offline You can download the entire documentation as a git repository, make loads of changes, and commit these again. The git repository is called https://github.com/2sic/2sxc.wiki.git Right now I'm using Visual Studio Code to edit this, and I must say I like the fact that I can make many changes and commit in one go, + the instant preview while typing is really nice: Working with images and asset-files Adding images is very difficult when editing online (there's no upload feature) but it's very easy when editing offline, because you can create folders and push them back. Please use the following structure for now assets (contains all the assets) logos (contains various logos, for re-use) contribute (assets for the page Contribute ) [page-name] (assets for each specific page) If you have any other image/file needs which need different structure, please discuss with Daniel @iJungleboy. About the Markdown Syntax If you're new to wikis or github comments / documentation, you may be a bit lost when it comes to markdown. I think the most important things you need to know are: Headers have 1-6 hashes in front, like ## Header 2 bold uses two * chars around the text, _italic_ uses one _ char, escaping chars uses the \\ slash (so any character right after a \\ is shown and doesn't format) Linking has many options, better read the manuals Lists have many options, better read the manuals Images use a ![alt-text](/assets/path/file.ext) syntax Note that line-breaks usually don't cause a line-break in the result (except in code-samples). You can enforce a simple line break by adding two spaces at the end of a line like \"check out: \" (two spaces after the \":\") Inline code starts and ends with a \"`\" character - like `code` - it will then look like code Multi-line code blocks start with three of these, like ``` var x = 17; // a comment ``` resulting in var x = 17; // a comment Multi-line code with syntax highlighting needs you to specifiy the language c#: ```c# var x = 17; // a comment ``` resulting in var x = 17; // a comment Copyright All docs are licensed as CC-BY .

It will look up the configuration in the CMS (like the Module-Settings in DNN) to determine what data is needed for the block. Usually it will then find a reference to a ContentBlock, from which it determines what content-items are assigned. It could also find that the template specifies a query, in which case it would retrieve that. Was previously called ModuleDataSource Data Source: CmsBlockDataSource / Module-Instance DataSource The Module-Instance DataSource DataSource is part of the Standard 2sxc/DNN Data Sources . It is the default data source as it directly delivers module-instance data and is used for all scenarios which don't explicitly have a query, and it can also be used as part of a query. How to use with the Visual Query When using the Visual Query it is already in the default / initial query: The above example shows: all data start in the cache ICache it is then by default passed through the PublishingFilter then it enters this Instance/Module, which gets the current ModuleInstance and passes on the data which has been assigned to it Using Module/Instance Data For Configuration Things get really exciting when you use values which the user edited in the module as a setting in your query. Here's an example: As you can see, the Default out of the ModuleDataSource is passed into the ValueSort data source with the stream-name Settings and is then used in a token to configure behaviour of the sort. Manually Assigning a Module Instance ID (2sxc 9.9) In 2sxc 9.9 we added the configuration dialog, so you can specify what module the data should come from. This allows you to have configuration-modules or primary-data-modules, which are re-used in queries: Programming With The ModuleDataSource DataSource We recommend to use the Visual Query where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript. It's also better because it separates data-retrieval from visualization. The only property you need to set is InstanceId (2sxc 9.9+) if you want to provide a different module-id.

How to use with the Visual Query When using the Visual Query you can just drag it into your query.

Connection There are two ways to connect to SQL databases: using a Connection Name (which points to a detailed connection string in the web.config ) or using a detailed Connection String as you need it. We recommend to use connection names where possible. If you provide both, the connection name will be used: The SQL-Query The Query section has quite a lot of options, most of which are not required but are important for this to work: Here's what you need to know Content Type all entities must have a type-name - so you can just enter something here - in most cases the exact name isn't important, because you usually don't refer back to this, unless further processing will try to filter this or something EntityId and EntityTitle when using entities in 2sxc / EAV, each entity must be able to supply a title and an ID which is an integer. This is important for internal data processing to work. For this to work with SQL, the source needs to know what data-fields to use for this. By default it will use a field called EntityId and EntityTitle , but you can also use any other field - in which case you must supply the names in the following fields. Using URL Parameters in Queries The SQL DataSource can also use queries which use URL Parameters. It's safe and automatically prevent SQL Injection. For example, you can do the following: SELECT TOP (1000) PortalId as EntityId, HomeDirectory as EntityTitle,PortalID,ExpiryDate, AdministratorRoleId,GUID,HomeDirectory, CreatedOnDate,PortalGroupID FROM [Portals] Where PortalId = [QueryString:Id] This will automatically use the id parameter from the URL to filter the result. Using Another Entity As SQL Parameter You can of course use the In stream to provide entities which configure the SQL. The following example has a content-type SqlSetting with only one item (to make the example easier to understand). The App DataSource delivers this in the AppSetting stream, which also goes into the Sql as AppSetting and is then used as a token in the SQL: Using A Value from a Module-Instance as SQL Parameter This works like in the App-example: Provide the data from the ModuleDataSource as an In stream to the SqlDataSource, and use that to filter: Programming With The SqlDataSource DataSource We recommend to use the Visual Query where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript.

From\"; // your sql here } @foreach(var post in AsDynamic(sql[\"Default\"])) { <div>@post.EntityTitle</div> } Important When Coding Note that data sources only retrieve data once, and then ignore any further configuration.

Here's a picture showing app data with or without publishing filter: Configuring the PublishingFilter DataSource The PublishingFilter has no configuration. How does it work? Since the published/unpublished is a very common query, internally the cache actually already provides different streams for this - and the PublishingFilter simply chooses the stream based on the current permissions. Programming With The PublishingDataSource We recommend to use the Visual Query where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript.

It provides all items of the current App or of another App if needed. How to use with the Visual Query When using the Visual Query you can just drag it into your query. Now you can create out-connections with the names of the types you need - which looks like this: There are three common use cases: 1. Using App With The Current App You can either just use it without any In stream, then it will just deliver the published items. This is because without an In , the App will automatically build an In providing published only. If you do provide any kind of in, it will use that as the source. So if you provide a Publishing-Source on the in, which will cause the App DataSource to differ the result based on the user who is looking at it. So editors would see unpublished as well: 2. Using App with Other App The App-DataSource can also be configured to deliver data from another app. For this, to configure and set the ZoneId and AppId: You can also deliver data from different Apps by using multiple App sources: Programming With The App DataSource We recommend to use the Visual Query where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript. It's also better because it separates data-retrieval from visualization. Important: to access data of the current App, please use the App.Data as it's a pre-build object with the same streams. For example, use App.Data[\"BlogPost\"] to get all the BlogPost items. An example code @{ var blog = CreateSource<ToSic.Eav.DataSources.App>(); blog.ZoneSwitch = 2; // go to Zone 2 blog.AppSwitch = 403; // go to App 403 } @foreach(var post in AsDynamic(blog[\"BlogPost\"])) { <div>@post.EntityTitle</div> } The previous example creates an App source to the zone 2, app 403 and retrieves all items of type BolgPost to show in a loop. Important When Coding Note that data sources only retrieve data once, and then ignore any further configuration. So you must set Zone/App before accessing the data.

It enhances the bootstrapping and provides you the syntactical 2sxc goodies in C# known from Razor. Where to Store the API Files All your WebAPIs are C# files saved in the special folder called api . The folder must be in root of your 2sxc app, and the files have to end with ...Controller.cs (this is a convention in ASP.net). New in 2sxc 9.35+ : you can now also create api folders as subfolders to run the api in multiple editions. This is an experimental polymorph feature which is still being worked out, but in general you can use the old and the new way: classic (single edition) [app-folder]/api/YourController.cs accessed url: [api-root]/app/auto/api/[Your] multiple editions: [app-folder]/[edition]/api/YourController.cs access url: [api-root]/app/auto/[edition]/api/[Your] Read more about urls in the WebApi docs. How to use A file named BooksController.cs could look like the following: using DotNetNuke.Security; using DotNetNuke.Web.Api; using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Net.Http; using System.Web.Http; public class BooksController : ToSic.Sxc.Dnn.ApiController { [HttpGet] [DnnModuleAuthorize(AccessLevel = SecurityAccessLevel.Anonymous)] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public object Persons() { return new ToSic.Sxc.Conversion.DataToDictionary(Edit.Enabled) .Convert(App.Data[\"Persons\"]); } } The custom controller BooksController must have the same name as the file and extends the ApiController controller. It has a method returning all items of the Persons data type. The method is decorated with several attributes: [HttGet] defines that the method must be invoked with HTTP GET [DnnModuleAuthorize(AccessLevel = ...)] defines the permission an invoker must have [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] ensures that a security token from the cookies is validated before the mehod is invoked You can implement any other methods. The custom controller can be called with JavaScript like this: <!-- this ensures the $2sxc scripts are loaded --> @Edit.Enable(js: true) <!-- the button which loads everything --> <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" onclick=\"getPersons(this)\"> Get Persons Custom </button> <script> // this script does the API call and then shows the result function getPersons(moduleContext) { $2sxc(moduleContext) .webApi.get('app/auto/api/books/persons') .then(function (results) { alert('Found ' + results.length + ' persons. \\n' + 'The first one is \"' + results[0].FirstName + ' ' + results[0].LastName + '\"\\n\\n' + 'The raw JSON: \\n' + JSON.stringify(results) ); }); } </script> The $2sxc API ensures that the GET request is send to the correct url /DesktopModules/2sxc/API/app-api/Demo/Get.

    "keywords": "Template Files Template files will generate HTML - often based on the data a editor entered, and/or which was provided from the App. Note As of now there are two types of template files: Token and Razor. The system is built in a way, that other templating engines could also be implemented at any time. How it Works Each View has a configuration referencing a template file. 2sxc will then decide what type it is, and run the appropriate engine. The template files usually reside inside app root folder or sub folder. As of now, there are two types: Razor / MVC - These always begin with an _ and end with .cshtml . Placeholders and code usually is marked with @ like @Content.Name Tokens - these always end with .html . Placeholders usually look like [Content.Name] . Tokens cannot have any server-side code aside from the basic placeholders. Tip If your view just hosts a JavaScript SPA, it will also be one of these types of files. Re-Using Templates Note Re-Using in many Views Sometimes you'll want to use the same template file in multiple Views. This can just be configured at the View level Tip Re-Using Templates Across Portals Instead of placing the template in the App-folder of the current portal, you can also place it in a global App-folder in the _default portal of DNN. This is great if you have the same app in many portals, and want to centralize the template. Tip Razor Templates also support re-using template parts or any C# code. You can also pass parameters to these parts, which allows you to share template-code across templates.

Background: Dynamic Code and Extension Methods Razor is dynamically compiled code, and many objects like Content are typed as dynamic . Because of this, the compiler can't be sure what's in a dynamic object, and also not what is in a Content.Tags - since this too is regarded as dynamic . This is why you can't just write Content.Tags.First() , because .First() is an extension method which the compiler must find first - but it can't do that, since it doesn't know that Content.Tags are of the type IEnumerable<...> . Solution #1 - use AsList(...) 2sxc 10.20 introduces AsList(...) which the compiler knows is an IEnumerable. Unfortunately if the the compiler isn't sure about Content.Tags , then it's also not sure about AsList(Content.Tags) . This is a minor inconvenience, since AsList(...) would figure things out, but Razor wants to be sure. So to use AsList() for solving this problem, you'll need to write AsList(Content.Tags as object) . That solves it. Solution #2 - cast as IEnumerable<dynamic> If you already know it's a list, you can also cast it as an IEnumerable<dynamic> . Since IEnumerable<T> is in the namespace System.Collections.Generic you have 3 options: Cast with full Namespace This is what the compiler actually understands - but it's a bit long and hard to read: var authors = (book.Authors as System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>) .Select(a => a.FirstName + \" \" + a.LastName); Cast with @using and IEnumerable<dynamic> This is the same thing, just nicer to read: @using System.Collections.Generic; var authors = (book.Authors as IEnumerable<dynamic>) .Select(a => a.FirstName + \" \" + a.LastName); Cast with @using Dynlist = ... This is the same thing, but the nicest, easiest to read method: @using Dynlist = System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<dynamic>; var authors = (book.Authors as Dynlist) .Select(a => a.FirstName + \" \" + a.LastName);"

    "keywords": "DataStreams DataStreams are objects which behave like a table, delivering a bunch of content-items. Common examples in Razor-templates are: the Data[\"Default\"] is a data-stream containing all content-items assigned to this template, ready to show the App.Data[\"Tag\"] is a data-stream containing all tag-items in the entire app. How to use The most commen uses will loop through all items in such a stream and show them. Here's an example: <ol> @foreach(var person in Data[\"Default\"]) { <li>@AsDynamic(person).FullName</li> } </ol> The @foreach will go through all the items. Each item is of the type IEntity . To make it easier to template, we convert it to a Dynamic Entity using AsDynamic and then we can just show the name with .FullName . In most cases we will need the loop-item a lot, and would preferr to not write AsDynamic every time. Because of this, we usually write the AsDynamic in the Loop, like this: <ol> @foreach(var person in AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"])) { <li>@person.FullName - born @person.Birthday and married to @person.SpouseName</li> } </ol> Advanced Use Cases There are some advanced use-cases where you need to know more about the IDataStream object, mostly when using LINQ. This is fairly rare, and if you really need to know more, it's best to consult the EAV DataSource code. Just a few more details you might care about: The stream has a property Source which points to the owning DataSource . a stream might be attached to many targets for further processing or for templating, but the stream doesn't know about this you can always enumerate the stream itself using LINQ, like var blues = Data[\"Default\"].Where(x => AsDynamic(x).Category == \"Blue\")) if you want more control over what you're looping through, there are two properties: the List property which is a IDictionary<int, IEntity> , and also lets you access it directly with your entityId if known, like Data[\"Default\"].List[1753] the LightList which is an IEnumerable<IEntity> of course there's always quite a bit more to it, like auto-caching, but you usually don't need to understand all that.

Ideally it's only used there, and when the content becomes obsolete, so do the assets that belong to it. Tip This is what ADAM is all about. It allows editors to just add images and files. ADAM will take these and magically store it somewhere so the user doesn't have to worry about folders and naming. Warning Since ADAM does everything behind the scenes, it's recommended that users don't try to link to files of another content-item, because that would defeat the purpose. It would also not allow any clean-up in future, because you wouldn't know if the asset was re-used. How ADAM works Internally ADAM creates a folder for each Entity (Content-Item) using the GUID of that item. It also creates a sub-folder for each field, so that a logo.png used in the Logo-field is separate from a my-case-study.pdf used in the CaseStudy-field. The final folder structure looks like this [portal-root]/adam/[app-folder-name]/[compact-entity-guid]/field/ How to Use ADAM is a standard part of 2sxc, it's automatically in use everywhere. Any link/file or wysiwyg field support drag-and-drop and will automatically store the file in the right place. Security Concerns ADAM uses the DNN file-numbering system by default, and keeps a reference to file:27 in the field linking such a file. In rare situations you may have many untrusted editors, where you want to prevent them asking the API for file:1 , file:2 , file:3 etc. There is an advanced switch to only allow resolving the file number if it's really part of the current item.

To get your current sxc-controller there are two objects $2sxc and sxc which you can just include it in your function definition, like module.controller('AppCatalogCtrl', function ($2sxc, sxc, $http, ...) { The sxc is the one you want most, it is already set to your current instance, so you can ask it things like sxc.manage etc. The $2sxc is the same as the global $2sxc object you know from jquery.

Notes and Clarifications On Bootstrapping Just fyi: in 2sxc 6.0 till 2sxc 8.8.0 the AngularJS bootstrapping needed to know the module-id. This was done by either providing an attribute like iid=\"@Dnn.Module.ModuleId\" or for tokens iid=\"[Module:ModuleId]\" providing the mod-id in the app name like sxc-app=\"MyApp-@Dnn.Module.ModuleId\" This is because it needs if for webservice calls. In 2sxc 8.8.1 the bootstrapping will auto-detect the module id, so you don't have to provide it any more. Read also Full explanation of bootstrapping and how/why etc. - which tells you why the current code is running so you could change the data added Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App Various AngularJS based apps History Introduced in 2sxc ??.?? sxcToolbar released in 2sxc 8.8.0"

As such, there are no predefined folders. You can create your own to organize your templates as you need, but the structure is completely undefined. Folder structure and special files of a 2sxc App A 2sxc app can have no folders at all, or hundreds. The following folders and files are special though, so you should know about them when you need them. Note that all apps are located in [portal-root]\\2sxc\\[app-name] . System Folders api this folder contains c# files for the web services this app has node_modules is the default folders when you use JS-automation while developing; it can be very large. This folder will be ignored when you export an app bower_components contains bower (run-time) dependencies for your JS and can become very large. Normally you will not want this in your app (because it contains a lot of unneeded stuff) so it too will not be exported when you create an app-package. Recommended sub folder names The following folders have no technical relevance, but we recommend this naming to improve consistency. src and sub-folders should contain your javascript source files in original (unminified, etc.) dist should contain your processed, minified, uglified and combined JS files Special files app-icon.png this file is an icon for the app - and will soon be displayed in various dialogs.

This is only loaded/included for editors/admin/super-users, and not available for users with limited permissions. If you want to enable this for more restricted users - for example when you want to use the 2sxc-form to let users add data - this must be enabled. That's what Edit.Enable(...) is for. How to use This example shows how you enable the UI using Razor, which will allow public users to create data: <div> @Edit.Enable(api: true, forms: true, context: true, autoToolbar: false) </div> This example ensures that api : basic JS for editing are loaded, allowing you to then run javascript commands like $2sxc(...).run(...) forms : additional JS is loaded, enabling the standard form dialogs to open context : the html contains context-information about the app, so that the dialogs actually work - see also edit context the auto-toolbars are disabled (this would generate a default toolbar if no toolbar was specified) Usage Notes This command simply enables editing - but doesn't provide any permissions or show any buttons yet. Here are a few things you must know to get this to work: remember to set permissions to allow what you want to do (like create new draft items for public users) Edit.Enable uses named parameters , so you always have to use the api: true syntax the Edit.Enable won't output anything in the position it's added, because it controls the main wrapper you must also create a link or toolbar in your code for the public users, as they won't have a button to press otherwise Read also Tutorial app for Public Forms Blog Recipe for using Public Forms with 2sxc History Introduced in 2sxc 9.30"

Writing this JS would be complicated to say the least, so the Edit object provides the Razor-Template an intelligent, fast way to generate what's necessary. How to use Here's a quick example of using the Edit object in a Razor template: <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> @Content.Title </h1> <div>...</div> This example shows the title and will add the standard editing-buttons for the Content item. Here's an Inner Content (Content Within Other Content) example: <div class=\"app-blog-text sc-content-block-list\" @Edit.ContextAttributes(post, field: \"DesignedContent\")> @foreach(var cb in @post.DesignedContent) { @cb.Render(); } </div> In this example, the Edit.ContextAttributes will add some attributes with JSON, which will help the toolbars inside that loop to correctly edit those items, and not the main item around it. What's In the Edit Object The Edit -object is always available in all Razor-templates. Read the API: IInPageEditingSystem . A short summary of what's inside Check or Enable Editing Mode Edit.Enable(...) allows you to enable editing functionality even if it's not available by user permissions, see more Edit.Enabled (boolean) Tells you if it's edit-mode or not, allowing your code to output other things if edit is enabled.

Reading [root-path]/app/auto/content/BlogPost/1050 would give you exactly one BlogPost item (with the id 1050) Create Content-Items/Entities Doing an http POST to this [root-path]/app/auto/content/BlogPost with a POST body of { \"Title\": \"changed title\"} would let you create the item.

Has many internal features for partial updates etc. But the primary purpose is to make sure the whole app is always available with everything. It also manages and caches relationships between entities of the same app. State This provides access to the in-memory state, to retrieve App catalog information from the cache or system (zones) to retrieve app states (or automatically load them if accessed the first time) Zone Contains all the basic infos about a Zone - usually cached Interfaces IApp An App in memory - for quickly getting things done with the app data, queries etc. IAppData An App-DataSource which also provides direct commands to edit/update/delete data. IAppDataConfiguration The configuration of an app-data - usually relevant so the source will auto-filter out unpublished data for normal viewers. IAppIdentity Marks thing which belongs to an App and a Zone and know their full identity. IAppIdentityLight Marks things which belongs to an App - but it may only know about the app, not about the zone. For a full identity, see IAppIdentity . IZoneIdentity Marks things which belongs to a Zone"

    "keywords": "Class StreamFallback A DataSource that returns the first stream which has content The StreamFallback DataSource is part of the Standard EAV Data Sources . It will pass on the first stream which has results. The order of evaluation is based on the names of the streams as they enter the StreamFallback. How to use with the Visual Query When using the Visual Query you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like: The above example shows a query from the blog app : a stream-fallback with 4 in-streams the first stream which would filter by tag, if the URL had a tag in it - as the test-data has no tag, this stream delivers no results the second stream filters by author - as the url would have an author (specified in the test-values), it does return items The StreamFallback therefor passes on the items provided by the author-filter. Note that while using the visual query, all other streams are also processed to show what's happening. At runtime it will stop processing other streams once it's found a first match. Programming With The StreamFallback DataSource We recommend to use the Visual Query where possible, as it's easier to understand and is identical for C# and JavaScript. It's also better because it separates data-retrieval from visualization.

Storage in the SQL Database in the EAV-Model This is stored in a special relationships-table, so internally the current DB IDs are used to track relationships. Storage in the SQL Database in the JSON-Model This is stored as an array of strings, which contain the GUIDs of the related information. Specials of the Entity type: The entity-type has these specials it's good to know about It's always a list It preserves the relationship order Special #1: It's always a List Since it could contain 1 or many items (and the configuration can change whenever you want), reading it always means reading a list. So you'll always use something like this (C#): // full name of author var fn = Book.Author[0].FullName; // in case you're not sure if the author was added or null, you can do var fn2 = (Book.Author.Any() ? Book.Author[0].FirstOrDefault : \"\"); // This will also work in newer versions of C# // making fullName either the name, or a null var fn3 = Book.Author.FirstOrDefault()?.FullName; // the following won't work! var wontWork = Book.Author.FullName; // this won't work Or the same in JavaScript: var fn = Book.Author[0].FullName; // in case you're not sure if it has any // this uses the JS-syntax which returns the last-value of an && condition var fn = Book.Author && Book.Author[0].FullName; Special #2: It preserves Order If the user said a book has 2 authors: Daniel Abraham Then it's sometimes usefull to preserve the order - in this case Daniel was probably the main author and Abraham helped out a bit. To allow for this, the Entity field will keep the order of items as they were added. Side-effect: Sometimes you want to have an A-Z order when showing items. As the order is not auto-sorted, you will have to do this yourself if you want to have them sorted. Use LINQ to do that. Null Values not Possible These fields will never return a null.

How to use AsEntity Here's a simple example of the tutorial DateTime DataSource : // create demo 1 entity with values related to today // first place all values in a dictionary // then convert into an Entity var today = new Dictionary<string, object> { {\"Title\", \"Date Today\"}, {\"Date\", DateTime.Today}, {\"DayOfWeek\", DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek.ToString()}, {\"DayOfWeekNumber\", DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek} }; // ...now convert to an entity, and add to the list of results var basic = AsEntity(today); var recommended = AsEntity(today, \"Title\", \"DateTimeInfo\"); This example shows how an entity-object is build using the basic syntax AsEntity(today) or with more configuration. Concept Behind AsEntity Internally, AsEntity will generate an IEntity object which is a simpler version of the normal Entity, because it's actually an IEntityLight , meaning it's missing some advanced features like multi-language and repository identity (which would be important in edit-scenarios). The simplest way is to just use AsEntity(someDictionary) , more advanced uses also tell the system which field is the title, some numeric or Guid IDs and more. Overloads / Variations The most common use case will be IEntity AsEntity(Dictionary<string, object> values); The full versions with all optional parameters as of 2sxc 9.13 is: // single item IEntity AsEntity( Dictionary<string, object> values, string titleField, string typeName, int id, Guid? guid, DateTime? modified, int? appId ) // many items IEnumerable<IEntity> AsEntity( IEnumerable<Dictionary<string, object>> itemValues, string titleField = null, string typeName = UnspecifiedType, int? appId = null ) All paramaters are optional, except the values. Here's what each one does: string titleField is the title field name, so the entity then also knows which one is the title and can support .EntityTitle property string typeName is a nice name for the type, allowing for type-filtering later in other data sources int id gives a number identity, so .EntityId is usefull and filtering by EntityId (like when having details-pages needing this id) works Guid guidId is a UUID identity, so .EntityGuid is usefull DateTime modified would allow to filter / sort by the .Modified property int appId could be used to pretend it's part of another app. This only affects the AppId property, and ATM there is no important reason to do this.

The ConfigMask builds a configuration token which will be used to get this setting, and also ensures that cachings mechanims vary the cache based on the result of the configuration. How to use ConfigMask Here's a simple example of the constructor of the DnnFormAndList DataSource , which expects 3 settings: public DnnFormAndList() { // Specify what out-streams this data-source provides. Usually just one, called \"Default\" Provide(GetList); // Register the configurations we want as tokens, so that the values will be injected later on ConfigMask(\"ModuleId\", \"[Settings:ModuleId||0]\"); ConfigMask(\"TitleField\", \"[Settings:TitleFieldName]\"); ConfigMask(\"ContentType\", \"[Settings:ContentTypeName||FnL]\"); } This example adds 3 configuration masks - let's find out what exactly happens. Tokens for Configuration Injection The EAV-System has a sophisticated system to get configuration based on tokens. You can read about configuration injection using tokens here . Registering and Resolving these Tokens with ConfigMask Internally a lot happens, but you just need to know the ConfigMask command. The syntax is: ConfigMask(key, mask) This will do the following Add this mask (using this name) to the configuration list register this key to be cache-relevant Read also Configuration using Tokens Ensuring configuration is parsed Demo App and further links FnL DataSource Demo Code History Introduced in 2sxc 9.13 to aid custom data sources"

    "keywords": "Optimizing Template Assets / Client Dependencies (JS & CSS) This page is about using DNN Client-Resource-Management aka DNN Client-Depedency-Management in 2sxc templates. Whenever a template needs additional files, specifically JavaScripts CSS Styles Image Resources Fonts These should be included in an optimized form to enhance performance dramatically. This is all about reducing the amount of server requests (very important for end-user performance) and delivering them in the order / places in the HTML-file, optimal for their purpose. So far 2sxc will take care of your JS/CSS files by bundling and minifying them, at the position and order you need. How to use Here's a trivial example for optimizing a CSS with default settings: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/style.css\" data-enableoptimizations=\"true\" /> Here's a more typical example, showing an optimization for a style & js which are inside the app-folder. This example uses Razor, so we use @App.Path to ensure it's picking up the right folder (use [App:Path] in token-templates): <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"@App.Path/assets/style.css\" data-enableoptimizations=\"150\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"@App.Path/assets/lazy.css\" data-enableoptimizations=\"bottom\" /> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"@App.Path/assets/scripts.js\" data-enableoptimizations=\"200:bottom\" /> </script> This shows: a CSS with lower priority (150 instead of the default 100) a css with which will be placed at the page bottom (so it will load later) a script-tag and specifies priority and placement inside the HTML document How it works Basically all <script> tags and all <link rel=\"stylesheet\"> tags can have a data-enableoptimizations attribute, which the system will parse according to the environments capabilities. In DNN 7/8/9 this means it can can assign priorities (to ensure load-order) can assign placement in the html-document (head, body, bottom) Understanding Priorities There is a fairly complicated article in the dnn wiki about client resource management which explains most of it. In general you can say that all DNN scripts load with priorities below 100, the default for all standard scripts is 100, and from there you can order things as you need them. We usually prioritize libraries like 2sxc or angular.min.js with 100 or larger, and then place our own script (like an app-blog.min.js) at numbers like 200. Understanding Placement Placement information can only be supplied in 2sxc 8.9 or higher. The three positions are: head meaning that the resulting data is requested in the HTML header. So it will be loaded before the page is rendered, meaning it's available right from the start but also delays page-build. This is often detrimental in terms of page-load times. this is the default location for CSS files body meaning it will be loaded in the beginning of the HTML body tag. Again this means it's there very early, but will slow down page buildup. this is the default location for JS files bottom meaning it will be loaded at the end of the html document. This is actually great for page-loading performance to improve above-the-fold loading. But it takes a bit of work to perfect its application.

Looking at it from the Platform like DNN, the entry object is an ICmsBlock which contains context information (in DNNs case, ModuleId etc.). Inside it is an IBlock which can itself contain more IBlocks. Note that each Block itself has Views IView and data specific to that block. Classes Render Block-Rendering system. It's responsible for taking a Block and delivering HTML for the output. It's used for InnerContent, so that Razor-Code can easily render additional content blocks. See also Inner Content (Content Within Other Content) Interfaces IBlock A unit / block of output in a CMS. IView Defines a view configuration which is loaded from an EntityBasedType . Enums Purpose These are the purposes of a block as it's being built. It can be built to generate a web-view, juts for indexing or possibly also for json publishing."

It has the following important methods: apiUrl(url) resolves a partial url like app/auto/api/Posts/All to the real url needed in DNN apiUrl(url, endpointName) special version of the apiUrl(...) method, for calling endpoints which are not in 2sxc headers() returns the headers you need to add to a WebApi call for it to work in DNN headers(moduleId) the headers incl. the one needed when addressing a specific module Internally this information is automatically retrieved from the html-header. The environment looks for a special meta-tag called _jsApi which contains all this information. This is new in 2sxc 10.25 and was added to avoid using jQuery when not necessary. Warning Internally all these commands need the env to be ready. This means that the entire html <head> tag was processed by the browser. A very safe way to do this is to run your code on-document-ready, or just to ensure that whatever bootstraps your application runs inside the <body> tag. Internal Stuff The http also has some internal methods like: apiRoot(endpointName) the full api-root to use in calling DNN or 2sxc endpoints.

You only need this if you wish to do custom JavaScript stuff in 2sxc, like retrieve data from a WebApi. Advanced cases where you need $2sxc: When you want to use view-data as an asyc-JS call if you wish to work with WebAPI REST calls if you want more control over the edit-experience with custom buttons etc. How to use add a script-tag to include the 2sxc.api.min.js note 1: in edit-mode this happens automatically note 2: always use lower-case paths and the minified version call the $2sxc(...) constructor to get a sxc-controller for your module (as each module on the page will have an own $2sxc controller) work with the API of the sxc-controller Here's a simple example of a template-file: @Edit.Enable(js: true) <script> $(function () { var modId = 17; var sxc = $2sxc(modId); alert(\"edit mode: \" + sxc.isEditMode()); }); </script> The code above shows how to include the api-file in the best way using @Edit.Enable(js: true) how the sxc-object is resolved how to ask if we're in edit-mode The moduleId is usually dynamic, so you can't hardwire it with var modId = 17 into your JS code. This is explained in the next section Initialization . Initialization of the $2sxc for a Module We have three initializers: $2sxc(DomNode) - recommended $2sxc(moduleId) - oldest way, very common $2sxc(moduleId, contentBlockId) - a special version for internal use only The Recommended HTML/DOM-Node Initializer We recommend the DOM-Node syntax , because in that mode $2sxc will go up through the DOM-tree and find the module it's in (or the content-block), and auto-configure itself. What's nice about this is that this method works without any server-side support (which you need for the other methods). Here's a simple example: <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run(\"layout\")'>layout</a> In the above example, the dom-node is given by the current click, which puts the current <a> node in the this object. Here's a JS example: var x = $(\".myApp\"); // get ANY dom element inside this 2sxc app var sxc1 = $2sxc(x); // use it // the same thing in 1 line var sxc2 = $2sxc($(\"#SomeNodeInThePage\")); Note that the simple example above assumes that there is only one item on the page, but there can often be more. So you'll usually need to do something like this // note that we cannot work before the page-onready. // so our code is in a $(our-code); $(function(){ $(\"some-jquery-selector\").each(function(index, element){ var sxc = $2sxc(element); // now do something... }); }); The Classic ModuleId method In this method, you need to get the ModuleId from somewhere, usually provided by the server-side template. In a Token-Template you would use [Module:ModuleId] and in a Razor-Template it's @Dnn.Module.ModuleID (large \"ID\"). The previous code in Tokens would be like: $(function () { var sxc = $2sxc([Module:ModuleId]); alert(\"edit mode: \" + sxc.isEditMode()); }) And the same code in Razor would be like: $(function () { var sxc = $2sxc(@Dnn.Module.ModuleID); alert(\"edit mode: \" + sxc.isEditMode()); }) You can also find an example of finding all of our nodes and initializing them in the TimeLineJS App . If you're interested, here's the js-initializer . Everything about the Module-Level sxc Controller In the module sxc controller you'll read about: The API of a module-level controller Calling commands, creating toolbars and buttons Working with JSON data of the current module Working with REST / HTTP Async Stuff Working with WebAPI calls, especially to your backend WebAPI in your api-folder Calling Queries (from the visual query designer) Technical Features Explained Including the $2sxc API JavaScript File Each template that needs the $2sxc-file when not logged in must include it, to be sure it's always there when needed. Note that we've included various features to prevent duplicate execution. if the file is included multiple times, it will only execute once if the file is included minified and unminified, it too will only be executed once if you need to debug the JS for whatever reason with F12 in the browser a sourcemap is included for more advanced debuging, just include the unminified version Note that the entire code is packed in an IIFE, so the only global variable created is the $2sxc . Everything is Cached We optimized for just about every thinkable situation, so the $2sxc will build a controller-object for a module, but following calls to it will use the cached information. Example: var sxc = $2sxc(42); // initial call, will build controller for Module 42 var sxc2 = $2sxc(42); // second call, will use cached controller var sxc3 = $2sxc(domNodeInsideTheModule42); // another call, will also used cached controller Metadata Needed by $2sxc to Work The $2sxc object needs a few pieces of information to work properly, which are stored in a JSON in the HTML. So the Module-DIV-Tag is actually enhanced with additional pieces of information. This structure is open and easy to read, but the structure can change from time to time, so don't read/rely on that JSON, use the $2sxc to access any information. There are even situations where additional metadata in inserted into the HTML rendered by your template. This has to do with inner-content (see next section) and the same \"don't rely on the JSON\" applies. Module-Instances and Content-Blocks This is a very advanced topic, so if you're new - just skip this. Also if you use content-blocks you don't need to understand this, it's just included for completeness. A 2sxc-module can contain many 2sxc-content-blocks since version 8.4 because an item could have independent, inner content-blocks. Because of this, the controller may need an additional parameter, so instead of $2sxc(moduleId) it can also use $2sxc(moduleId, contentBlockId) . As mentioned above, you never need to work with this, it's included for completeness. Since the now recommended method to initialized $2sxc is not with the moduleId but with a DOM-node, that call will automatically resolve everything correctly. Additional properties of the $2sxc Controller In 2sxc 9.30 a new object $2sxc.cms was added - read about it in $2sxc.cms TODO: document the properties, mention that they won't be stable in future versions Till we find time to document more, please consult the $2sxc API Background: How $2sxc works This is just some info for you to better understand what happens behind the scenes: How Module-Level Information is found When you use $2sxc(moduleId) it scans the DOM for the <div> tag that contains the module with that ID When you use $2sxc(htmlNode) it starts from that node and scans all parents till it finds the <div> which is the module wrapper Once it finds that, it knows what module it's for and configures itself How Page and Portal Information is Found This is for information the $2sxc needs for WebApi calls. This here applies to 2sxc 10.25+ It first checks the html-head section for a meta tag with the name _jsApi . If this exists, it contains a JSON with everything it needs. If that doesn't exist it will retry 3x times (in case the head wasn't ready yet) and otherwise falls back to the old mechanism. The old mechanism is to ask DNN and the ServicesFramework for this information. This is always available when you're logged on as an editor, but it's only on the page for anonymous users IF ...you are either using the old mechanisms ...or your Razor code asked for with @Edit.Enable(js:true) Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App TimeLineJS all the JS-apps including AngularJS in the app-catalog More links: Description of the feature on 2sxc docs History Introduced in 2sxc 04.00 Enhanced with cms (see cms ) in 9.30"

    "keywords": "JQuery in DNN and 2sxc Often you'll need and want jQuery, but when you don't it shouldn't be loaded for performance reasons. Tip Removing jQuery and jQueryUI will boost your mobile PageSpeed like crazy. So only include it on pages where you really need it. How DNN Auto-Loades jQuery There is some history to this which we'll explain briefly. DNN made jQuery a first-class citizen around DNN 4, and since then most of the UI was jQuery based. For a while there even was a standard that buttons etc. should be built and styled with jQuery UI. That is not the case any more. You can now easily run DNN (at least in browsing mode, not editing) without jQuery. But because jQuery was always there developers never noticed that they could leave it away, and many parts like Templates would simply rely on them. There were also many things that automatically added jQuery but were never noticed. Here some important examples: 2sxc always used the ServicesFramework of DNN which internally auto-added jQuery Most DNN websites use popups for login, and just doing this automatically adds jQueryUI and jQuery to the page. You can easily stop this using the recipe Remove jQueryUI from my page In case your code is running on a page without jQuery but you need it, your code should tell DNN that you want jQuery, like this: Warning Don't manually add urls to the jQuery files, make sure you use the official API. This should help you prevent loading jQuery multiple times and avoid conflicts between jQuery version. Tip If you do need a newer version of jQuery, that is possible but needs some tweaking to get them to run side-by-side. It's done using the jQuery.noConflict() . How 2sxc loads jQuery in DNN Up until 2sxc 10.24, every 2sxc module automatically loaded jQuery because 2sxc used the ServicesFramework of DNN Starting from 2sxc 10.25 old templates auto-load jQuery for backward compatibility. This includes token-templates and Razor templates which don't have an @inherits statement at the beginning. Anything new done using the RazorComponent will not do that unless your template code requests it. In 2sxc 10.25 and newer, all core features of 2sxc don't need jQuery. So anonyomus browsing of your site won't require jQuery at all, even if you're doing API calls or using the $2sxc javascript API . But what you do need (if you're using the new RazorComponent ) is to tell 2sxc that you plan to use JavaScript and APIs, so that 2sxc can add the stuff to the page to make the magic happen. This is done with this line in your razor code: @Edit.Enable(js:true) Because 2sxc doesn't use jQuery any more for normal stuff, this will have the following effect: Add a special header to the page containing information needed for API calls Load the 2sxc.api.min.js in the correct way It's important to note that this will not load jQuery."

Here are the most important features enable / disable the entire quickE enable / disable module quick-edit enable / disable inner-block quick edit To do this, just add a quick-edit-config=\"{...}\" attribute to any DOM node with the desired configuration. Here's what will happen if you add it to a skin-dom-node, you can set \"defaults\" like \"never enable at all\" if you add it to a view-template, you can change the behavior if that view is included Why include configuration it in a View? As explained above, quickE changes it's behavior by default if it finds inner-content. This is desired on details-views, but not on templates which just create more complex content on a normal page. So on these templates, you could add a config to continue enabling module-quick-edit. The Configuration Object Structure config = { enable: true, // default modules: { enable: null // auto-detect, can also be true/false }, innerBlocks: { enable: null // auto-detect, can also be true/false } } A Quick Razor Example If you want to add this attribute only when the user is editing the page, the best way to do it is like this: <div @Edit.Attribute(\"quick-edit-config\", new { modules = new { enable = true }})> ... </div> Read also Inner Content Blocks - blog about inner content-blocks Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App Accordion (collapsible sections) 2sxc blog History Introduced in 2sxc v08.04 Enhanced / made configurable in 2sxc 08.06.01"

How to use Each content-block (usually a DNN-Module) has it's own 2sxc-controller, which also gives you a prepared manage-object to work with. Here's an example <a onclick='$2sxc(this).manage.run(\"layout\")'>layout</a> this click-event will look up the 2sxc-controller using $2sxc(this) , then use the manage-object provided by this to then run the layout command. The layout command opens the change-template dialog. Here's an example to generate a toolbar from code: <p class=\"sc-element\"> mouse over this to see the js toolbar generated by the groups of buttons <toolbarsGroups></toolbarsGroups> </p> <script> var toolbarsGroups = { groups: [ { buttons: \"layout,more\"}, { buttons: \"app,zone,more\" } ] }; $(function(){ $(\"toolbarsGroups\").each(function(index, element){ var controller = $2sxc(element); var toolbar = controller.manage.getToolbar(toolbarsGroups); $(element).replaceWith(toolbar); }); }); </script> The example above has a function which will look for all <toolbarsGroups> tags and replace them with the HTML provided by manage.getToolbar(...) . How it works Basically the manage-property only exists when the user has edit permissions, as 2sxc will automatically include the necessary JS in the page. So if the user doesn't have edit-rights, the .manage property will be undefined . If it does exist, it can be used to do perform these kinds of actions. Properties and Methods We try to keep APIs very light, so all the internal properties/objects are not documented and should not be used.

    "keywords": "Introduction to WebAPI and REST APIs To use 2sxc/EAV data in JavaScript, from Mobile Apps or from other websites you need endpoints which will provide the data. 2sxc and EAV have everything prepared to make this easy for you and to ensure security - especially to ensure you only publish data you intend to publish. A few terms to clarify before we begin: REST means that there is a url convention to access data like .../blogposts/25 REST also specifies that an HTTP GET is for reading, HTTP POST is for writing, etc. All the APIs use JSON for sending/receiving data. This is the default schema . Tip ➡ read about the URLs for using these endpoints Standard Content/Entity REST Endpoints These endpoints already exist and allow normal CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. To use them, you would need to enable the permissions and then you can access them using the REST URLs. Standard Query REST Endpoints Every Visual Query you create has a REST URL. If you set the permissions, you can then read from the Query through REST. You can also pass query-parameters in the URL. Custom C# WebAPI You can easily create custom C# WebAPIs, and then access them through the URL. What these endpoints do is completely up to you. Once you have opened the security on a standard endpoint or once you have created your custom endpoint, you can then access it from JavaScript, Mobile Apps or external systems.

    "title": "URLs for WebAPI and REST APIs | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "URLs for WebAPI and REST APIs One of the most confusing aspects when using the REST API or custom WebApis is finding the right URL to talk to the API. Read this to help you understand what's going on and get started quickly. Tip When you're using JavaScript and the $2sxc controller , everything happens automatically. In that you don't need to understand the details of the URL, but this should help you in other scenarios. Basic URL Schema Every 2sxc REST URL is built with the following parts: [root]/app/[app-identity]/[part]/[specifics] The root is determined by DNN and changes a bit by DNN version, portal, and language configuration. more The app-identity says what app we're addressing. It's often auto for auto-detection, but when auto-detection isn't available, it's the app-folder name. more the part determines if we're accessing content , query or api of the app. The specifics is a path part describing what exactly what we're accessing and varies depending on the API. Root The Root in DNN 9+ In DNN 9 the root was shortened to: [portal-root-with-language]/api/2sxc/... Note The old root from DNN 7 and 8 still work in DNN 9 for compatibility. The Root in DNN 7 and 8 DNN 7 & 8: [portal-root-with-language]/desktopmodules/2sxc/api/... Warning An easy thing to overlook is that in DNN 7 and 8 it was 2sxc/api but in DNN 9 it's api/2sxc App-Identity The App-identity can be either the word auto to use auto-detection, or the app-folder-name if you can't use auto-detection. Tip Whenever you're working in DNN and accessing the endpoint from a module that contains the same App, then you should use auto-detection. Warning Auto-Detection relies on DNN mechanisms which send TabId and ModuleId in HTTP-headers. 2sxc uses these headers to figure out what App you're using. If something fails in auto-detection, you're probably not using the normal DNN conventions for making REST calls. Warning When calling an endpoint from another website or a mobile App, you cannot use auto but must specify the app-folder name. Warning If you're not using auto-detection, then the root path must be absolutely correct. Here's why: If you have multiple portals then each portal could have other apps, or sometimes even the same app (like a Blog app). In this case, the root-path says what portal is being used, which in turn is important to get the correct app. App-Identity Examples To access an API (in this example the content ) from JS code in the same app you can rely on auto-detection of the app, like this: .../app/auto/content/... To access the same Glossary-App from elsewhere, like from the skin (for example, to highlight all words to which your glossary-app has definitions), from another app, or from another website, you would specify the folder name as auto-detection won't work. Like this: .../app/Glossary/content/... This applies to all endpoints like content , query , api . Part Content If your part is content then you're using the normal content/entity REST API. It supports all common HTTP verbs. In this case you have the following possibilities after content/ : .../content/[YourContentType] HTTP GET will retrieve all items of this type .../content/[your-content-type]/[item-id] where item-id is the number or the GUID HTTP GET will get one item HTTP POST is used to create an item or update it HTTP DELETE will delete the item Warning This requires that permissions are configured to allow it. The permissions are very powerful so make sure you understand them. Tip You can also configure permissions in ways that allow users to only create draft items (which would then require an admin to publish it) Content Example Assume you have the blog-app installed and your JS would request a JSON from this endpoint (logged in as host, so security is not an issue): [root-path]/app/auto/content/BlogPost ...then your JS would receive a JSON with all BlogPost items. More examples: Reading [root-path]/app/auto/content/BlogPost/1050 would give you exactly one BlogPost item (with the id 1050) HTTP POST to [root-path]/app/auto/content/BlogPost/1050 with a POST body of { \"Title\": \"changed title\"} would let you update the item 1050. Part Query The Query endpoint can be accessed on .../query/[your-query-name] . Note that Query endpoints only support the HTTP-verb GET, since it's read-only. Warning This requires that permissions are configured to allow it. The permissions are very powerful so make sure you understand them. Tip Make sure you give your queries simple names without spaces if you intend to use them in REST calls. Query Example Assume you have the blog-app installed and your JS would request a JSON from this endpoint (logged in as host, so security is not an issue): [root-path]/app/auto/query/BlogPostsByAuthor?Author=Daniel%20Mettler This would run the pre-defined query and return the Blog Posts of the author Daniel Mettler . Part Api Custom WebAPI use one of these schemas .../api/[controller-name]/[action-or-more-params] .../[edition]/api/[controller-name]/[action-or-more-params] Your C# code determines what HTTP-verbs will work (GET, POST, etc.). Your code is also responsible for determining what permissions are used, like Anonymous etc. The [edition] is relevant if you're using Polymorphism . So if you don't specify an edition, the controller is expected to be in the [AppFolder]\\api but if you do use polymorphism the controller must be in [AppFolder]\\[edition]\\api .

    "keywords": "In-Page Editing Context (technical) To ensure that client-side commands like edit can work (this includes all toolbar functionalities), the in-page scripts must pick up various things like AppId and more. This is provided as an Edit-Context and looks a bit like this: <div data-edit-context='{ \"Environment\":{\"WebsiteId\":0,\"WebsiteUrl\":\"//.../en/\",\"PageId\":56,\"PageUrl\":\"http://.../en/\",\"parameters\":[{\"Key\":\"TabId\",\"Value\":\"56\"},{\"Key\":\"language\",\"Value\":\"en-US\"}],\"InstanceId\":421,\"SxcVersion\":\"9.30.0.40333\",\"SxcRootUrl\":\"/\",\"IsEditable\":true}, \"User\":{\"CanDesign\":true,\"CanDevelop\":true}, \"Language\":{\"Current\":\"en-us\",\"Primary\":\"en-us\",\"All\":[]}, \"ContentBlock\":{\"ShowTemplatePicker\":true,\"IsEntity\":false,\"VersioningRequirements\":\"DraftOptional\",\"Id\":421,\"ParentFieldName\":null,\"ParentFieldSortOrder\":0,\"PartOfPage\":true}, \"ContentGroup\":{\"IsCreated\":true,\"IsList\":false,\"TemplateId\":3770,\"QueryId\":null,\"ContentTypeName\":\"e2351b42-87f2-427e-9566-ff271e3e5a9f\",\"AppUrl\":\"/Portals/0/2sxc/Content\",\"AppSettingsId\":null,\"AppResourcesId\":null,\"IsContent\":true,\"HasContent\":true,\"SupportsAjax\":true,\"ZoneId\":2,\"AppId\":2,\"Guid\":\"c238e78b-a6e5-4811-a5c9-51d5ebf48b39\",\"Id\":3894}, \"error\":{\"type\":null}, \"Ui\":{\"AutoToolbar\":true}}'> <span>more stuff...</span> </div> How the Edit-Context is Added By default, it is automatically added if the system detects that the current user has edit-permissions. In 2sxc 9.30 a feature was added to add the context in code, using the Edit.Enable(...) command. Inner-Context for Inner Content When inner content is used, each block of inner-content will change the context, because it will have different IDs etc. So inner-content blocks will add their own context-attributes. See also [Edit.ContextAttributes](xref:Razor.ContextAttributes]. How JS Picks up the Context In most cases the context is picked up automatically - like in such a code: <a onclick=\"$2sxc(this).run('edit', ...)\">edit</a> This kind of code traverses the HTML to look for the closes context-node, and uses it to figure out everything automatically. The second auto-pickup method uses the module/content-block ID, like this: <a onclick=\"$2sxc(4203).run('edit', ...)\">edit</a> This will also find the context, but instead of traversing the DOM upwards, it will check all DOM objects on the page and find the appropriate one for this ID. What's in the Context This information is just conceptual. Do NOT try to access these values in your code, because they will change, and it's not part of any public API! . The concept contains things like: versions (so that the UI can behave as needed and correctly load scripts with cache-breaking) urls so the GUI can perform certain actions correctly language information for the GUI various IDs like the current zone/app, item-IDs, module-IDs etc. Using Edit Context in Your Code You should not use this in your code, as it's not a public api and will change from time to time.

    "keywords": "Polymorphism aka Editions aka Open-Heart-Surgery (WIP) Imagine you have a running system and you want to make some changes on the live installation. During the time you work, you would always risk breaking the site, but we usually don't have the time to create a staging environment. Enter Polymorphism. Note that this is not a complete solution yet. We're working on this and have parts of it working, and will add functionality step-by-step. Let's compare the perfect multi-edition (polymorph) setup to the classic solution: Progress As of now (2sxc 9.35) we have achieved the first step, allowing the WebAPI controllers to be polymorph. So this is the current state of development: This means that: Api Controllers are already fully polymorph. They can be placed in a subfolder like [app-root]/live/api/WtfController.cs and can be accessed using a url with the edition in the name, allowing multiple identically named controllers to be used. Views are polymorph if you do the view selection manually. This means, you can place your views in a subfolder like [app-root]/live/list.cshtml and then have an entry-point [app-root]/list.cshtml which will choose which edition to use - then using @RenderPage to pick that edition. This is still manual, because we're not sure yet what the perfect implementation is, so we would rather wait before standardizing a bad solution. Everything that is data (schemas, items, queries, settings and resources) is still one edition only. The data model is able to perform multi-edition content-management, but we're not ready yet to provide the UIs etc. for this, as it could lead to confusion, so we'll hold back on this for now. How to use WebApi Polymorph (2sxc 9.35+) As of now, to use the WebApi Polymorp, this is what you would do: instead of placing your WtfController.cs in the [app-root]/api/ folder, you place it in a [app-root]/live/api folder. the live, default JS would then access it using [dnn-api-root]/app/auto/live/api/Wtf You can then copy this controller to [app-root]/dev/api and make your changes there. In your JS, you would then (while testing/developing) access this edition using [dnn-api-root]/app/auto/dev/api/Wtf without causing problems on the live solution, as all other users are still accessing the live edition, while you're working on the dev edition. Once everything works, deploy (copy) the now modified WtfController.cs from the dev/api folder to live/api and all users benefit from the changes. How to use Views Polymorph (manually) As mentioned above, this isn't automated yet, but the vision is clear, and it works ca. like this: place your real views - let's say list.cshtml not in the [app-root]/list.cshtml but in an edition folder - like [app-root]/live/list.cshtml . In the root, also create a [app-root]/list.cshtml , but this will basically just render the file from the editions folder, using @RenderPage(\"live/list.cshtml\") Now, determine how you want to switch between editions - for example based on a cookie value or host-user. Add this logic to the [app-root]/list.cshtml to determine the edition you want to use, and based on this if()...else()... to render either the live/list.cshtml or dev/list.cshtml Now you can work on the dev/list.cshtml without affecting live users. Once it's ready, deploy (copy) the dev/list.cshtml to live/list.cshtml Next Development Steps Next in line, we want to standardize a few things, like: Providing a UI or something to move/deploy one edition to another, so that you can work in staging, and then use a UI or something to deploy your work to live. This should also auto-backup what was in live before, in case you want to roll back. Standardize how a to automatically determine which \"morph\" a user is in and how to set the user to this morph, making it easier to use and removing the requirement for \"switcher-views\" which determine which real view to show. For now, Data-Polymorphism is low priority, because we're not sure yet if we can \"pull this off\" in a way that won't confuse the users.

    "title": "QuickE (Quick Edit) | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "QuickE (Quick Edit) QuickE (pronounced quick-e ) is the quick-edit feature inside 2sxc to quickly add / move modules and inner content blocks. It supports touch and usually is used with a mouseover. In the current version, it allows you to do the following in normal view-mode: add a content or app module on any position in a DNN panes move / delete any DNN module using a copy-paste concept send any DNN module to an empty pane (which couldn't do paste, as the target is invisible) add a content or app content-block to any inner-content area move / delete any content-block inside an inner-content area Since version 2.0 you can also configure some of this at skin and template level. How to use By default any page that has any 2sxc module added will automatically load quickE because it needs it to provide buttons/toolbars for inner content blocks. We also recommend to include the JS in the skin by default, so that quickE is already enabled on empty pages as well. You can find the necessary asp.net web-control in our Bootstrap Instant Theme Here's how: <%@ Register tagprefix=\"Edit\" tagname=\"QuickEdit\" src=\"~/DesktopModules/ToSIC_SexyContent/DnnWebForms/Skins/QuickEdit.ascx\" %> <Edit:QuickEdit runat=\"server\" /> The above lines first tell .net that this control QuickEdit exists, and then adds it to the page using the <Edit:...> tag. Note that this tag won't create any HTML, it will just tell DNN that it must load the relevant JavaScripts when a user is logged on. Once it's included, it will just work automatically. Auto-Disabled Module-Quick-Edit on Details Pages By default quickE will change it's behavior if it finds inner-content blocks. The reason is that often inner-blocks are found on child pages of something, for example in blog-post details. If the user could insert both modules and inner-content on a details page, then the user would often by accident insert modules (instead of content-blocks). The user would believe that he did the right thing, when in reality the newly added module would now show up on all other details-pages as well. Now there are cases where this auto-disable shouldn't happen - for example in accordeon-style modules which are used on normal pages. This can be configured as explained below: Configuring quickE Quick-Edit Since quickE 2.0 (released in 2sxc 8.7) you can now also configure it a bit.

    "title": "How To Customize the Toolbars | 2sxc and EAV 10",
    "keywords": "How To Customize the Toolbars A lot in 2sxc is fully automatic. But sometimes you want to customize how the content editor can work. Note 2sxc 10.27 introduces a much simpler system, which is what is shown here. Previously everything was possible, but quite complicated. So if you find examples out there which look very different - they work as well, but here's the simple system. Overview - What You can Customize You can customize just about everything: hover-behavior - you may want hover, maybe not, and maybe to the right | left colors using color names, hex-codes or CSS classes of the entire toolbar or just of individual buttons you can just enhance/change the default toolbar or create a custom one with just your buttons you can change the button groups - add, remove etc. you can add/remove buttons as you need you can create buttons with custom icons you can even call custom code from your custom buttons Tip This overview will get you started, anything more advanced will need the specs . Important This will show you how to do things in Razor, but the same principles apply to plain HTML-Toolbars. We assume that 99% of all toolbars will be initiated from razor, so that's what we'll be showing here. Getting Started with Custom Toolbars Usually your code will look a bit like this: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> ... </div> This will create a standard hover-toolbar with some buttons and the more ellipsis button. Note that the exact combination of buttons is auto-detected. So you may just have an edit but you may also have an add etc. depending on the template and the data it receives. It looks approx. like this: Add our First Button Let's add an extra new button to create an item of the content-type Category . Note This code will make the button appear, but on click you may see an error, because you probably don't have a ContentType Category in your app. <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: \"new?contentType=Category\")> ... </div> You should now have an extra + button like this: Let's emphasize it, because for whatever reason it's a super important button: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: \"new&color=red?contentType=Category\")> ... </div> You should now have a red + button like this: Important The term new in this example means we want a button of type new which will open the dialog to create new entities. We could also write app&color=red which would add a button to manage the app. So new ≠ 'new button' but 'button to add a new entity'. The full list of button names can be found in the CMS Commands list . Adding more Buttons Now we want to add another button - maybe to add a Tag . The toolbar attribute on the Edit.TagToolbar can take various kinds of objects, but for the new simple API it only accepts string objects or string[] arrays. So to make multiple changes to the toolbar, we'll have to give it a string[] array like this (note that we can use line-breaks, to make the code easier to read): <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { \"new&color=red?contentType=Category\", \"new&color=teal?contentType=Tag\" })> ... </div> You should now see this: Removing Buttons with - Now maybe you don't like to allow your editors to change the view - so let's do the same but remove the view-switch button as well using the remove - prefix: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { \"-layout\", \"new&color=red?contentType=Category\", \"new&color=teal?contentType=Tag\" })> ... </div> So you can add / remove any button you want. You can find a full list of button names (command names) . Modifying Existing Buttons with % But what if we want to modify an existing button? Let's change the icon and both colors of the layout (view) button using the modify % prefix: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { \"%layout&icon=icon-sxc-replace&color=white,maroon\", \"new&color=red?contentType=Category\", \"new&color=teal?contentType=Tag\" })> ... </div> As you can see, we just used % to modify a button, set the icon and 2 colors. Show Only Our Buttons But maybe we would prefer to have a toolbar with only the two add buttons, and nothing else. By default, the toolbar uses a template called default which contains all these buttons. But you can always start with an empty template. You'll find the full list of templates here . <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { \"toolbar=empty\", \"new&color=red?contentType=Category\", \"new&color=teal?contentType=Tag\" })> ... </div> Tip As you can see, the principle is to use a toolbar template and make modifications to it. Showing the Delete Button Warning A special case in modifying buttons is also to force-show the delete button which is hidden by default. The reason it's hidden is because in most content-editing scenarios the editor should be able to remove content, but not delete it - in case it's re-used elsewhere. But let's say you created a News App and want to allow the editor to also delete the news-items. Here's how: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: toolbar: \"%delete&show=true\")> ... </div> The delete button is in the third group of buttons, so you'll have to hit the ellipsis a few times to see it. You'll then see: Adding Custom Groups Let's assume you understand the principle of adding, removing and changing buttons. Let's add a custom button group with only the buttons you want - followed by the normal ellipsis-button with the standard functionality: <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: new [] { \"group=add-buttons\", \"new&color=red&group=add-buttons?contentType=Category\", \"new&color=teal&group=add-buttons?contentType=Tag\" })> ... </div> You'll get this result, and hitting the ellipsis will show you the default buttons as you can see in the second image: Note We had to give our new group a name - in this case add-buttons and told the new buttons that they should go inside that group. Tip A new group can also go after the default group of buttons. If you add a &pos=1 or another number the group will be placed later on in the sequence. There is also a hidden group called edit-advanced - you can find the list of groups here. As of now, it only contains the delete button which is hidden by default. Attaching Custom JavaScript Code to a Button Now you may want to call your own code when you create a button. This is very advanced stuff, but here's how: <div class=\"demobox\" @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, toolbar: \"custom&title=Message?call=myMessage&id=17\") > This demonstrates a custom button with the call-name in the parameters. </div> <script> function myMessage(context, event) { console.log(context, event); alert('hello from my Message - got this id:' + context.button.command.params.id); } </script> You'll then see this toolbar, and on click this message: You'll notice that we have a ?call=functionName and also an id=17 just to show how additional information is passed around. Your function also gets an event from the browser, so you can check the event.target and other things to see what was actually clicked. Warning This is very advanced stuff, you may run into difficulties to get this to fly 😉. Debugging Custom Toolbars In most cases if your problems will be caused by invalid syntax. It's easy to forget a closing quote \" or a comma , to separate values. So always check that first. If you really want to do deep debugging, you should use the $2sxc.insights() command in the console to see what whas processed and how. If you add ?debug=true to the url of the page, it will also log way more intermediate data for you to review. Read More Basically you have what it takes.

For example: toolbar=empty tells the system to load the empty template new?contentType=Person will add a button new for the type Person edit?entityId=5593 will add an edit button for the item 5593 These instructions are provided as a JSON array of strings - like this: [\"toolbar=empty\", \"new?contentType=Person\", \"edit?entityId=5593\"] Examples of Build-Instructions Every build instruction consists looks as follows: \"\" - an empty string is valid but not very useful \"/this is just a comment\" - a comment if you need to document something inline \"new\" or \"+new\" - add a new-button \"-edit\" - remove a button - like when slimming down a default toolbar \"%delete&show=true\" - a button modifier - to change a default (the delete button is always hidden by default) \"group=my-group\" or \"+group=my-group\" add a button-group \"+group=my-group&pos=2\" add a button group at index 2 (so in the 3rd-position, 0-based) \"new-quote=new?contentType=Quote\" - an identifier followed by a button name - when having multiple new buttons \"%more&color=red\" - a modifier which changes the color of the icon General Syntax of a Build-Instruction The general syntax is as follows (build-instruction)(&build-params optional )(?call-params optional ) Build Instructions A build instruction consist of 1-3 parts an optional prefix like + to add a button or group (this is the default if no prefix is given) % to modify a default thing - like change a the color of the new-button - to remove a button or group from the list $ for system/global things (this is the default if the command is toolbar , params or settings ) / a comment - like \"/here comes a special add-button\" a command and optional addition like toolbar - for setting the default toolbar template toolbar=default will load the default toolbar with all standard buttons toolbar=empty will load an empty toolbar without any buttons settings - for configuring the toolbar settings - see below params - for parameters which are used in all buttons - see below group - to add a group of buttons group=my-group-name gives the group a name, for placing buttons in it `-group= add , edit etc. - all known commands of buttons Build Parameters ( &... ) If you have a build-instruction and need to add some parameters you must separate them with an & and add the parameters in url-style, like &color=red . Build Parameters for Toolbar ( toolbar ) The toolbar currently doesn't have any additional parameters. Build Parameters for Settings ( settings ) Settings affect how the toolbar is shown. These are the known settings: &color=... - specify a different button - see color &hover=left or =right or =none - default is right &class=my-class to add one or more classes to the toolbar Build Parameters for Params ( params ) Params don't have any additional settings - they only have parameters (after the ? ). See below. Build Parameters for Groups ( group ) Groups currently don't have additional parameters. Build Parameters for Buttons Buttons can have the following parameters: &icon=icon-class-name allows you to set an alternate icon &color=... gives the button another - see color &show=true or &show=false - force show/hide a button Most common use case is to force-show or hide an existing button. For example, if you think it's ok to show the delete button, just use delete&show=true &class=your-class add one or more classes to the button to affect styling &title=some-text - mouseover message Call Parameters ( ? ) Most instructions can have additional call-parameters - separated by a ?... . For example, this would create an additional + button to create a new contact: add-contact=add?contentType=Contact Call Parameters for Toolbars & Settings The toolbar and settings don't have any additional parameters. Call Parameters for Params Params at the global level will be used by all buttons. The most common params are entityId=some-number - mainly used for edit, delete etc. entityGuid=guid-guid-guid - mainly used for delete contentType=ContentTypeName - mainly used for adding new items title=some-text - mainly used to show a title when asking to delete something isPublished=true|false prefill=field1=val1;field2=val2 etc. for list management useModuleList=true|false sortOrder=# Special Notes Colors Both settings and buttons can have an &color=... parameter. The ... can be just one color or two, like &color=red,green or &color=brown . When specifying colors you can either use standard names like red or HEX-codes like FF0000 . You cannot use the # hash symbol, so when specifying hex-colors, always just write the characters. The button rendering system will auto-detect hex color codes. Note that you can also use semi-transparent hex-codes, like FF000088 . Groups The following button groups exist by default. You can target them to add your buttons, or remove them using -group=name : default - the main initial buttons like edit, add etc. list - anthing having to do with the current list - move-up/down etc. edit-advanced - advanced, not-recommended buttons like delete view - anything related to the view - edit template etc. app - app related buttons Read also check out the list of commands/buttons Demo App and further links You should find some code examples in this demo App TODO: History Added to 2sxc 10.27 in March 2020"

Version 10 Version 10.01 - 10.09 LTS Develop and fine-tuning of the new Edit-UI based on Angular 8 Version 10.20-00 to 10.20-05 Enhanced ListCache so it will prevent parallel buildup - important for long-loading DataSources like SharePoint DataSources Updating to RazorBlade 3.1 which doesn't need extension methods Version 10.20-06 Created AsDynamic(string) Created AsDynamic(DataSource) to enable AsDynamic(Data) instead of AsDynamic(Data[\"Default\"]) Version 10.21 New AsList() for better code New AsDynamic(string) to work with json /dist/ is now cleaned up on every update, to better distribute changing JS file structures Version 10.22 Query Params added for Visual Query Created QueryRun DataSource Insights now includes the code file and line numbers Insights now also measures time needed to execute some code Various performance enhancements Improved SoC for AppsCache and AppRoot DataSource Version 10.23 Lots of logging enhancements Version 10.24 LTS New stable LTS Improved/fixed QueryRun DataSource Improved Insights Enhancements to use 2sxc with Redis Cache WYSIWYG enhancements for better H1-Hx, P and Blockquote Performance enhancements Intenal refactoring for APIs Introduced an internal Compatibility-Level to disable very old features when using new RazorComponents Version 10.25 LTS Changed how the $2sxc client JavaScripts are loaded for much better performance and better Google PageSpeed Enabled various features for the Content area which previously were hidden, like Resources and Settings Released brand new Content-Templates App with best-practices for 10.25 Fixed bugs with Evoq Page Publishing Enhanced the ValueFilter DataSource to handle dates which were null Version 10.26 TinyMCE Updated to 5.1 Enhanced CreateInstance API to also work when compiling Razor files from a WebApi New DataSource StreamPick New automatic Param called [Params:ShowDrafts] to be used in VisualQuery - returns True or False New tokens [App:AppId] and [App:ZoneId] to use in VisualQuery calles (dropdown from query) Changed List-Caching behaviour to create more reliable cache-keys for complex queries (previously it only went through Default streams to generate the cache-key) Version 10.27 Possibly breaking changes Because the dynamic entity list now has a type which is dynamic, it cannot be cast to List<dynamic> any more. IList<dynamic> works, but in case you have any code casting it to List<dynamic> you'll need to change that to either IList<dynamic> or IEnumerable<dynamic> . New Features / Major Improvements Changed DynamicEntity so that accessing a property which contains many other entities it will return a DynamicEntityWithList . This allows Razor files to access the properties like .EntityId or .FirstName of the main entity in a sub-list easily without requiring AsList(...) #1993 Updated Quick-Dialog to use Angular 9, Ivy and the latest Dnn-Sxc-Angular #1992 New DataSource AttributeRename #2004 Completely refactored internal list management API #1995 Complete refactoring of the inpage code to make it typesafe (no more any types) Created brand-new, simpler way to create custom Toolbars and specs Introduces JS/API 2sxc-Insights for debugging In-Page code Enhancements Performance-Enhance App DataSource to delay building objects until needed #1991 Performance-Enhance internal Token Lookup #1998 Enhanced DNN Search Index logging #1997 Corrected help-links on all data sources #1994 Bugfixes Cache-All-Streams only used the Default-Streams for Cache-Key identification #1988 QueryRun DataSource doesn't show statitics on all streams #1989 Modified date and Owner information were missing on json stored entities #2005 / #2006 Fixed bug in JS API for non-2sxc endpoint resolution #2000 Queries didn't resolve DNN tokens when accessed in the Search Index #1999"

    "keywords": "@Edit.TagToolbar and @Edit.Toolbar Methods in Razor / .net 2sxc has a cool in-page toolbar system - here you'll find a conceptual overview around the toolbar . These toolbars are usually hover-buttons like this: Technically the entire Edit-UI is JavaScript based, so all the buttons, events etc. are client side scripts. Writing this JS would be complicated to say the least, so the @Edit.TagToolbar(...) and @Edit.Toolbar(...) are your tools of choice for adding toolbars from Razor. How to use Here's a quick example of using the Edit object in a Razor template: <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(Content)> @Content.Title </h1> This example will output the item title in an h1 tag and add a hidden, appear-on-mouse-over toolbar with editing-buttons for the item named Content . Let's assume you're building the details-page of a news-app and you only want the edit/remove buttons, to improve the UI for your use case. Additionally, you want the mouse-hover to react on the whole article, not just oven the title. Here's how: Warning 2sxc 10.27 introduces a new, simpler API to customize the toolbar. So the instructions below are technically correct, but not recommended any more. Check out the much simpler toolbar customizations @* this will show an \"edit and remove\" button for the current item *@ <div @Edit.TagToolbar(Content, actions: \"edit,remove\")> <h1> @Content.Title </h1> @Html.Raw(Content.Body) </div> Here's a different example, how to create a toolbar with only one button, namely an add new item button to create a new BlogPost-item. @* this will show an \"add\" button if the current user is an editor *@ <h1 @Edit.TagToolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\")> @Content.Title </h1> As you can see, the actions: \"new\" tells the toolbar to only show this one button, while the contentType: \"BlogPost\" says what content-type this new item should be. As this toolbar won't have buttons that modify an existing item, it doesn't need that parameter. How it works This command is part of the Edit object and used in Razor templates. It provides a simple API to generate in-page buttons if the current user is an editor. It also checks if edit should be enabled (based on security specs) and will then generate some HTML/JavaScript at that location. Common Tasks Here are a few snippets that you'll typically need, saving you from reading all the docs in common scenarios: Edit.Toolbar(employee) creates a default toolbar for the content-item employee with all default buttons like edit, change-view, more, etc. Edit.Toolbar(employee, actions: \"edit\") creates a toolbar for the item employee but only with the edit -button. Edit.Toolbar(employee, actions: \"edit,add,remove\") creates a toolbar with three buttons edit , add , remove Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\") creates a toolbar with one button, namely new which will open a new BlogPost form. @Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", prefill: new { Title = \"Hello\", Color = \"red\" } ) creates a toolbar with one button, namely new which will open a new BlogPost form, and prefills the Title and Color field. The Toolbar Actions Note: at the moment, the buttons are grouped into bundles like initial buttons list buttons template / view buttons app buttons The actions can be a combination of known button-names. Here's the current JavaScript catalog of commands : The following commands all require target to be set, or they only make sense in a List-setup - see also content and not as data . new open a dialog to create a new item, requires a target or a contentType parameter edit to edit the current item publish will optionally show the publish-button, but only if the current item is not published. add opens a dialog to create a new item just like new, but will add it below the current item in the content list remove will remove (not delete) this item from the content list moveup will move the item up one position in the content list movedown will move the item down one position in the content list sort will open the sort dialog of the content list replace will open a dialog to swap the current item in the content list Note: the command metadata - is a bit special, not supported in the actions parameter - use the complex toolbar: instead and read the instructions for the JS Commands . For many more commands you should check the JS Commands ), which covers many more like app-import , layout , develop , contenttype , contentitems , app , zone , more etc. More About the Prefill Basically this is a .net object which will be serialized to JSON and used to prefill a new item. Usually you'll just create a new, anonymous object like new { Title = \"xyz\", Date = ... } . example @Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", prefill: new { Title = \"Hello\", Color = \"red\", Link = \"page:\" + Dnn.Tab.TabID } ) This example will prefill the title, the color and in the link field add a reference to the current page. Multiple Entities Prefil For this you must simply provide an array of strings, like this: @Edit.Toolbar(actions: \"new\", contentType: \"BlogPost\", prefill: new { Tags = new string[] {\"08387a10-1aac-494a-9eb5-1383e31490eb\",\"b498a694-047a-4e51-a285-50f9a64edda1\"} }) Styling the Toolbar As of now there are only limited stying functions: Floating the Toolbar This happens automatically, if a surrounding HTML-tag has a class \"sc-element\". more... What Really Happens with the toolbar As previously noted, the toolbar actually puts some html/js into the page, which the javascript $2sxc object will pick up and work with. Quite a lot happens on the client, and that will be documented some other day. Here just the short version: js runs, picks up Toolbars jc reviews DOM to see what context it's in (either the module-instance or an inner-content) js generates buttons if a button is clicked, an action-manager then executes the correct action on the correct item Older @Content.Toolbar Syntax Is Deprecated Note : there was an older @SomeContentItem.Toolbar syntax and this still works, but we ran into architecture issues, so we decided to place all advanced functions into the Edit.Toolbar(...) method. This is the way to go from now on, the old syntax will continue to work but is not recommended any more.
