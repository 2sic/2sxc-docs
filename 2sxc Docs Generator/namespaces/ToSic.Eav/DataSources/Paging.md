The **Paging** [DataSource](xref:Specs.DataSources.DataSource) is part of the [Standard EAV Data Sources](xref:Specs.DataSources.ListAll). It will limit the items returned to a _page_ containing just a few items, and will also provide a _paging-information_ so that the UI knows what page it's on and how many pages remain.  

## How to use with the Visual Query
When using the [Visual Query](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Queries.VisualQueryAttribute) you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like:

<img src="/assets/data-sources/paging-basic.png" width="100%">

The above example shows:

1. a content-type filter limiting the items to type _Company_
2. a Paging which only passes on the first 3 companies of page 1

## Using Url Parameters for Paging
This example shows how you can use the Url Parameter to page through the results:

<img src="/assets/data-sources/paging-page-from-url.png" width="100%">

...you could also set the page size from other tokens like url or app-configuration, like this:

<img src="/assets/data-sources/paging-page-size-app-settings.png" width="100%">
