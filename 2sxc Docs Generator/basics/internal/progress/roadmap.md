# Roadmap of EAV and 2sxc - Vision of the Future

The 2sxc roadmap contains the things we think are fairly important to tackle next. Since we're all working for free, there is no commitment to do this in the order you see below. And sometimes a customer will need a feature quickly - and pay for it - then it will appear sooner. _You too can sponsor a feature!_

## Next Priorities (2021 Q4)

1. Release all template apps as hybrid (ATM 95%, missing: Mobius, News, Events)
1. Finalize release without jQuery (ca. Nov 2021)

## V13
1. IToolbarService and ToolbarBuilder
1. Release Monaco as primary editor with more file templates etc. (ca. Nov 2021)
1. Database re-organization ca. Dec. 2021
1. Provide more help UIs for using REST APIs
1. Make the Metadata-System completely discoverable


## Future / Other
* [ ] Support for persisting data to the file-system instead of DB
* [ ] Files DataSource
* [ ] ADAM DataSource
* [ ] Pages DataSource
* [ ] Navigation DataSource
* [ ] ...or whatever is needed next :)
