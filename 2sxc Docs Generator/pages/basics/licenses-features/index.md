# Licenses and Features

[!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]

2sxc 13 introduces licenses and features. 

* **Licenses** are keys which _allow_ the use of advanced features in 2sxc.
* **Features** are settings which _activate_ certain features in 2sxc.

Some **features** require a **license** to be activated.

The other features are simply configurable to improve your security. 

## Licenses in 2sxc 13

### Core Free License

This is the default license which is auto-enabled for everybody, and covers 99.9% of all features.

> 99.9% of 2sxc is free for everybody to use.

> Only some really advanced features require a license. 

### Patron / Supporter License

This is the most basic license and we hope everybody will apply for this license ðŸ˜‰. 
Basically if you become a supporter of 2sxc, you will get some goodies as a special thanks. 
Goodies include: 

1. Ability to paste images from clipboard into file-fields and wysiwyg.  
  (note: this works with all kinds of bitmap, but will not work if the image has transparent parts, because transparency in the clipboard isn't standardized)
1. Hide "sponsored with ðŸ’– by 2sic" on ADAM
1. Enhance automatic `<picture>` tag generation to include newer formats like WebP automatically

### Enterprise CMS License

This is a special license which activates Enterprise CMS functionality which only very sophisticated sites need. As of now, they are:

1. Ability to inherit Apps across sites - useful for installations with many sites using the identical apps
1. Ability to specify edit permissions for each language

### WebFarmCache Licenses

This is used to synchronise web server caches across multiple websites in Farm Scenarios. 

## How to Get and Install a License

As of now (February 2022) licenses cannot be purchased yet. 
We're still working on this - should become available Q1 2022.

Licenses currently require [manual installation](xref:Basics.LnF.Licenses.Manual). 
This too should be improved by the end of Q1 2022.
