## Where to Start

2sxc is an easy to use dynamic content system for .net Platforms like DNN. 
If you are just getting started, then this is probably not where you should be looking. Focus first on:

1. Content on [2sxc.org](https://2sxc.org/) like the [learn section](https://2sxc.org/en/learn)
1. Apps on [2sxc Catalog](https://2sxc.org/en/apps) which contains many ready-to-use apps like blogs and news, as well as tutorials 
1. The [DNN Tutorials](https://2sxc.org/dnn-tutorials/en/) on 2sxc.org

With that knowledge, you can already create amazing stuff. 

> Everything you find here is very advanced and you won't need it for normal everyday work.
