# Oqtane Platform

[Oqtane](https://oqtane.org/) is a modern [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) based platform similar to Dnn. It's inspired by the Dnn model but uses the latest .net core and more. 

As of now (March 2021) we are porting 2sxc to work on Oqtane and Dnn. The work is still in progress.
