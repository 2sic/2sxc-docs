The **StreamMerge** [DataSource](xref:Specs.DataSources.DataSource) is part of the [Standard EAV Data Sources](xref:Specs.DataSources.ListAll). It will create a new stream containing everything which came into this data source.  

## How to use with the Visual Query
When using the [Visual Query](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Queries.VisualQueryAttribute) you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like:

The above example shows two filters finding items and delivering them on the same stream. 

## Example Using ItemFilterDuplicates
A common scenario will also combine this using the [ItemFilterDuplicates](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.ItemFilterDuplicates), in case various in-streams deliver the same item:

## No Settings
The StreamMerge DataSource has no settings to configure.

Note that it will automatically merge the streams in A-Z order of the In-Stream names.
