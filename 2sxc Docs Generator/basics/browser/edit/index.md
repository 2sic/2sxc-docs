2sxc has powerfull CMS features, most of them just work by magic. 
You can also modify the behavior to fit your needs.

When users edit content they usually use in-page buttons to access edit-dialogs and more. Here is a short overview and links to what you need to know.

## The Standard Edit Dialogs

Editing mostly happens in stand-alone dialogs which are JavaScript based (built using Angular). These dialogs are typically dialogs like

1. edit an item
1. edit a combination of items - like a _content_ item and an assigned _presentation-settings_ item

This is documented in [](xref:Basics.Browser.EditForm.Index)

## In-Page Toolbars and User Experience

The edit UX begins in the page showing the content/data. Things like

* toolbars opening dialogs or performing actions like _publish_, _move up/down_ etc. 
* quickE (Quick Edit) to add / move / delete modules in the page
* inner-content editing
