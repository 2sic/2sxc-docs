# 2sxc Docs

This repo is the source for the current https://docs.2sxc.org.

We keep it in a separate repo so docs-changes don't clutter the git-history of the EAV/2sxc software. 

You can find the main source repos which generate these docs here:

1. [2sxc](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc)
1. [EAV Server](https://github.com/2sic/eav-server)
