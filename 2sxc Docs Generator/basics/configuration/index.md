# Configuration, Settings and Resources in 2sxc âœ¨ new!

[!include[](~/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>.context-box-summary .data-configuration { visibility: visible; }</style>

Settings can be a complex issue as the should have an effect on differenc scopes. Here are some examples:

1. An input-field may have a setting to show/hide a button
1. An App may have a setting which affects the entire App
1. A system may have a setting which affects the entire installation

In an ideal world, these settings can compound each other to determine defaults, fallbacks and overrides. 
2sxc has some of this ready, other parts are still in development. 

> [!TIP]
> In 2sxc/EAV we talk about **Configuration** when something has a standard set of properties and about **Settings** when the properties can vary dynamically. 
> 
> So an _App-Configuration_ contains standardized aspects like the Folder it's in, while _App-Settings_ can be a dynamic set of properties that are different in each App.
>
> **Resources** on the other hand are simply meant for language/culture specific labels, logos and similar. 
> They are also dynamic, so they can have as many values as you need.

## Global Level

### Global Configuration

As of now (v12) global Configuration only exists for [Features](xref:Basics.Cms.Features.Index) which can be enabled/disabled at the system level. 
This is primarily for security reasons. 

In addition some minor global Configuration exists for alternate Caching systems (like using Redis) but this is only for [2sxc Professional](https://2sxc.org/en/web-farm-cache).

### Global Settings and Resources

<img src="./assets/apps-management-goto-global-settings.jpg" class="right-thumbnail">

Global Settings and Resources were introduced in 2sxc 12.04. 
You can configure them in the _Default App_ of the _Default Zone_ (usuall Zone 1 App 1). 
Here you can configure both the standardized `SystemSettings`/`SystemResources` or create an own content-type called `Settings`/`Resources` for custom values. 

In C#/Razor you can access them here:

* [Settings Stack](xref:Basics.Configuration.SettingsStack) using the `Settings` [object](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Objects.Settings). 
* [Resources Stack](xref:Basics.Configuration.ResourcesStack) using the `Resources` [object](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Objects.Resources). 

Note: _there are some global ADAM Settings that can be configured in a different way, but it's not standardized/finalized yet, so not public, and we'll try to move that into the new standard._

## Site Level (Portal) 

### Site Configuration

Only [Languages](xref:Basics.Cms.Languages.Index) are configured at Site-Level. 

### Site Settings and Resources

<img src="./assets/apps-management-goto-site-settings.jpg" class="right-thumbnail">

Site-Level Settings / Resources were introduced in 12.04. You can configure them in the _Default App_ (usuall the **Content** App). 
Here you can configure both the standardized SystemSettings or create an own content-type called `Settings` for custom settings. 

In C#/Razor you can access them here:

* [Settings Stack](xref:Basics.Configuration.SettingsStack) using the `Settings` [object](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Objects.Settings). 
* [Resources Stack](xref:Basics.Configuration.ResourcesStack) using the `Resources` [object](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Objects.Resources).

## App Level 

### App Configuration

Apps have a standard [App-Configuration](xref:Basics.App.Configuration) containing their version, name, folder etc. 

In Razor you can access this on the dynamic `App.Configuration` object.

### App Settings

Apps can have custom [App-Settings](xref:Basics.App.Settings) and [App-Resources](xref:Basics.App.Resources) which every app manages itself. 
The names/types of these settings can be freely configured, as each App has a Content-Type called **AppSettings** which can have different fields as needed. 

In C#/Razor you can access them here:

* [Settings Stack](xref:Basics.Configuration.SettingsStack) using the `Settings` [object](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Objects.Settings). 
* [Resources Stack](xref:Basics.Configuration.ResourcesStack) using the `Resources` [object](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Objects.Resources).

## View Level

### View Configuration

Each view has [View-Configuration](xref:Basics.App.Views.Index) containing the name, how it works with data and more.

In Razor you can access basic View information on the `CmsContext.View` object, or the entire configuration on the dynamic `CmsContext.View.Configuration` object.

_View Configuration was introduced ca. v4 and made accessible to Razor in v12.02_

### View Settings and Resources

A view can have Views-Settings and View-Resouces which apply to all uses of this View. 
Since View-Settings could be _re-used_ in various views, the concept more flexible than _App Settings/Resources_, meaning that you could re-use both the content-type as well as the settings data. 

In C#/Razor you can access them here:

* [Settings Stack](xref:Basics.Configuration.SettingsStack) using the `Settings` [object](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Objects.Settings). 
* [Resources Stack](xref:Basics.Configuration.ResourcesStack) using the `Resources` [object](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Objects.Resources).

## Content-Type Level

### Content-Type Configuration

Each Content-Type has [Content-Type Configuration](xref:Basics.Data.ContentTypes.Index) with the description, icon and more. 
The Configuration can be multi-language.

### Content-Type Settings and Resources. 

There are no Content-Type settings or resources.

---

## Attribute (Field) Level

### Attribute Configuration

Each [Attribute / Field can be configured](xref:Basics.Data.Fields.Index) as needed. The configuration options depend on the Attribute-Type. 
The Configuration can be multi-language.

### Attribute Settings and Resources

There are no Attribute Settings or Resources.

---

## Entity (Item) Level

### Entity Configuration, Resources and Settings

An Entity just has the data it caries, and no additional intrinsic Configuration, Settings or Resources. 
Entities themselves are multi-language.


### Per Entity-Use (Item-Use) Settings aka Presentation Settings

Items can have a per-use setting called **Presentation** - see [Content-Presentation](xref:Basics.Content.Presentation). 
This means that when the item is shown in a specific view, there may be settings which configure how it's to be shown. 
Since each View may need different settings (a map View could need other presentation-settings than a text/image View) this is specific to each _use_ of an Entity.


### Per List-Use Settings aka Header-Presentation Settings

If a View is configured to be a List then it can also have a **Header** and also **Header Presentation Setttings** which work just like [Content-Presentation](xref:Basics.Content.Presentation).
