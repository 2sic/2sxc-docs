# TODO: @2ro

While developing JS apps, it's often useful to have different editions of the app.
This is a form of Polymorphism - but it goes a lot further.
What you usually need is:

1. The ability to see a "dev" version of the app, with extra logging, debug features, etc. while the end-user only sees the "prod" version.
1. The ability to serve a local hot-build edition of the app while developing, which comes from your own PC instead of DNN.

This is what JS App Editions allow.
