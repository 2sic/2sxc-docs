If your site has a role called `2sxcAdministrators` (before v14 `2sxc Designers`)
it will change what Admin users can do.

* Without the role `2sxcAdmisitrators` all Admins are regarded as **SiteAdmins** and can do anything
* With the role `2sxcAdmisitrators` all Admins are treated as **ContentAdmins**
* With the role `2sxcAdmisitrators` all Admins which have this role are again treated as real **SiteAdmins**
