### Class Custom.Dnn.Code12 for Dnn ☢️

This is the Dnn specific base class. It's the very same as `Custom.Hybrid.Code12` except for the additional `Dnn` Property. 

Because of this, the documentation here only shows `Dnn` - for all other properties go to [Custom.Hybrid.Code12](xref:Custom.Hybrid.Code12)

> [!TIP]
> If you don't need these special properties, we strongly suggest to move to the Hybrid implementation.
