# Roadmap of EAV and 2sxc - Vision of the Future

The 2sxc roadmap contains the things we think are fairly important to tackle next.
Since we're all working for free, there is no commitment to do this in the order you see below.
And sometimes a customer will need a feature quickly - and pay for it - then it will appear sooner.

> [!TIP]
> You too can sponsor a feature to make things happen sooner!

    1. Umbraco integration
1. In-Page direct upload / replacement of images
1. In-Page direct editing of texts
