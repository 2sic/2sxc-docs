The **Shuffle** [DataSource](xref:Specs.DataSources.DataSource) is part of the [Standard EAV Data Sources](xref:Specs.DataSources.ListAll). It will randomize the order of items which came in. This is common for components which show "3 random quotes" and similar scenarios. 

## How to use with the Visual Query
When using the [Visual Query](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Queries.VisualQueryAttribute) you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like:

The above example shows:

1. a content-type filter limiting the items to type _Company_
2. a shuffle which only passes on 3 random companies
