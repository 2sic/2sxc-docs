# Changes to the Environment for Developers

[!include["_contributors-only.md"](../code/_contributors-only.md)]

> [!TIP]
> As we improve 2sxc we also adjust DB and Web.Config settings.
> In a normal installation this will be automatically done.
>
> Yet if you are developing 2sxc, then you make updates without running the official installer.
> So if you are working with the dev environment, you may need to do this manually.

The menu to the left will give you the changes you must apply for each version.
