# App Extensions - Data and Schema (ContentType)

<!-- [!include[](~/pages/basics/stack/_shared-float-summary.md)]
<style>
  .context-box-summary .data-all,
  .context-box-summary .query-app,
  .context-box-summary .process-razor,
  .context-box-summary .process-web-api-app,
  .context-box-summary .edit-ui-custom
  { visibility: visible; }
</style> -->

Extensions can include custom data and schema (ContentType) definitions which are either used by the extension itself or can be used by the App as a whole.

> [!TIP]
> This allows you to create small libraries of data and schema definitions which solve a specific problem,
> and then share them across multiple Apps by installing the extension in each App.

For Data and Schema (ContentType) extensions, you may choose to create one or more of the following:

1. Content-Types: Custom Content-Types to define the structure of your data.
2. Default Data: Predefined data entries that come with the Content-Type.
3. Queries: Visual Queries, which are included in the data bundle.
4. Views: View definitions, which are included in the data bundle.

## TODO: more instructions @2rb

The idea is that you explain in this central location, how to do everything, and then link this page from the other pages which explain each part in detail.
