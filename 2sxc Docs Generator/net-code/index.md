# C#, Razor & Dynamic Code (WIP)

When people implement solutions using 2sxc, most of their server-side code will be written in C# to create `.cs` or `.cshtml` files in the App folder:

1. Custom Razor templates (`_*.cshtml` files)
1. Shared Razor snippets (`_*.cshtml` files)
1. Razor Code-Behind files (`_*.code.cshtml` files)
1. Custom WebApi controllers (`*Controller.cs` files in the `api` folder)
1. Helper code (`*.cs` files in any folder)

> [!TIP]
> All of these files are in your App folder as **Dynamic Code**, which has three core features:
> 
> 1. The code remains as source code in the app-folder, ready to be changed at any time
> 1. Changes are immediately live without restarting or recompiling the system
> 1. Cool APIs ðŸ˜Ž help this code work with dynamic data (Entities) having dynamic properties

In addition to the dynamic code above you can also access 2sxc in other places - like in WebControls of the DNN theme. You don't get all the simple APIs but this too can be super useful. It's covered in [External Code](xref:HowTo.External).

## Quick Example

The variable `person` in the following Razor template is a **Dynamic Entity** - meaning that it can have different properties depending on the configuration. In this case it seems to have `FirstName`, `LastName` and `Gender`. 

```razor
<div @Edit.Toolbar(person)>
  @person.FirstName @person.LastName - @Text.First(person.Gender, "unknown")
</div>
```

The code first creates a `div` tag which would show a hover-toolbar (to admins only) for editing the `person`. It then shows the names and the gender - which if not determined will show as `unknown`. 

> [!NOTE]
> This kind of code is easy understand for people who know HTML. 
> It's also very easy to customize if you need a different output - since it's basically HTML and placeholders. 

## What's Where

This documentation contains the following sections

1. [Dynamic Code](xref:NetCode.DynamicCode.Index): the shared API on all Dynamic Code - Razor, WebApi or other.
1. [Razor](xref:NetCode.Razor.Index): the APIs special to Razor templates
1. [Web API](xref:WebApi.Custom): everything you need to know to create/customize Web API Controllers
1. [External API](xref:HowTo.External) guides you to access 2sxc-instances on the server from WebForms or other MVC components
