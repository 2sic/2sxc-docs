# Oqtane Platform

[Oqtane](https://oqtane.org/) is a modern [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) based platform similar to Dnn. It's inspired by the Dnn model but uses the latest .net core and more. 

ðŸ‘‰ As of May 2021 2sxc works great on Oqtane as well. 

## Install Oqtane and 2sxc

ðŸ‘‰ See [](xref:Abyss.Platforms.Oqtane.Install)


## Features currently not implemented


#### Global Content Files

ADAM works and images uploaded will automatically work. But as of now, you cannot have shared files in a global folder structure for re-use in many places yet. You can of course re-use an entity with files, but not place a file in a global (like Portals) folder for use. 


#### Image Resizer won't work on Global Content Files

Image Resizer works for app-assets (like the app-icon) and for ADAM assets, but not for files in the `\Tenants\x\Sites\x\` folder
