# All DataSource Objects in 2sxc / EAV

2sxc provides a large set of [DataSource](xref:Specs.DataSources.DataSource) objects which either get data from somewhere (SQL, CSV, ...) or modify data on the `In` and passing it to `Out`. This page will give you an overview and link you to further sources if you need to know more. 

## How to use
Many data-sources are simply used in the [Visual Query](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Queries.VisualQueryAttribute), and if all you want is visual-query, then this reference will give you an overview regarding what things are possible. It will usually look like this: 

<img src="/assets/data-sources/app-out-2-in-0.png" width="100%">


If on the other hand you want to program with these [DataSource](xref:Specs.DataSources.DataSource) objects, then it will usually look a bit like this: 

An example code 

```c#
// A source which can filter by Content-Type (EntityType)
var allAuthors = CreateSource<EntityTypeFilter>();
allAuthors.TypeName = "Author";

// Sort by FullName
var sortedAuthors = CreateSource<ValueSort>(allAuthors);
sortedAuthors.Attributes = "FullName";

```

The previous example creates an initial source `allAuthors` which has all data on the in, then filters to only provide those of type _Author_ to the out. This is then piped to the `sortedAuthors`, which sorts on the _Attributes_ field. 

## Understanding Data-Flow and Configuration
This is explained in the [DataSource documentation](xref:Specs.DataSources.DataSource). 

## All Public DataSources
These are all the data sources which are either provided in the default installation of 2sxc, or which are available for you to install (manually).

          This is
      part of the "Unpublished-Data" concept. Since each item could be
      either published or draft, this helps you show the correct ones for the
