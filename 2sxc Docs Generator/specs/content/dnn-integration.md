# 2sxc Content in DNN

The vision of 2sxc is to be cross-platform, so we hope one day it will also run on NopCommerce and other systems. This is how it's integrated into DNN.

## What DNN References to

### Portal to ZoneId Mapping

The EAV has a virtual container called a **Zone** which is similar to a Portal in DNN. The IDs will not match though, so each Portal has a setting called `ToSIC_SexyContent_ZoneID` which contains the ZoneId for that portal. 

When 2sxc is used the first time on a portal, it will detect a missing ZoneId, which triggers zone creation and sets this value. 


### Module-Installation to App-Installation Mapping

A DNN Module installation corresponds to an App installation. Internally there is no mapping, as it is not necessary. 

There is an important difference though: in DNN, each installed Module is installed at the _System level_, so installed Modules are available on all Portals. On the other hand, Apps are installed at the _Zone (Portal) level_, so each app is only available on that portal. Customizations to the app also only affect that portal, and each Portal could have the same App installed in different versions. 

> [!NOTE]
> Technically there are a few ways to share Apps, their data, templates etc. across Portals, but these are fairly advanced scenarios. 


### Module-On-Page to ContentBlock Mapping

In DNN each modules has _Module Settings_ to store configuration. 2sxc stores these two pieces of information in the Module Settings:

1. App ID - what app is being shown here
1. _Content Block_ ID - the GUID of the _Content Block_ Entity containing the rest of the configuration

Understanding how this ties in helps you make better decisions. Make sure you also read [](xref:Specs.Content.Index)



## Basic Setup: Content is assigned to the module

This is the most common setup - and used in the **Content** module as well as in many **App** modules, which rely on the author to manually create content for this specific module. It's not usually used in data-oriented modules like news, blogs, etc. See also []

Here is how it's mapped:

## Manually Managing this Data

Note: you shoudn't usually do this - but sometimes you have to. Check out this short explanation:

## FAQ

1. If a page or module is deleted, does it also delete the _Content Block_?  
No. Note that if a page or module is deleted, it goes into the DNN trash, so it could always be restored again. 
1. If a page or module is deleted from the trash, does it also delete the _Content Block_?  
No. DNN does not inform modules about delete actions, so we can't do clean-up.
1. Are _Content Blocks_ which don't appear on a page orphaned and can I delete them?  
Maybe. Since they could be used in other apps (see [](xref:Specs.Content.Index)) as _Inner Content_, there is no quick way to tell if it's being used elsewhere.
1. Can a _Content Block_ be used on multiple modules / pages?  
Yes. It's not common, but since a module can be shown on multiple pages or even on other portals, it would show the same _Content Block_ there as well.
