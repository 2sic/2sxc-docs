# MoT Policy (Moment of Truth)

Every few years 2sxc is released as an **MoT** version, a.k.a. **Moment of Truth**.
To sync expectations, we want to explain what this means.

> [!WARNING]
> MoT for 2sxc means clean up and shaking off history.
>
> It helps us remain relevant and clean, but it may affect you if you used old or internal APIs or code.
>
> We believe it's most likely to affect you, if you had very old Apps installed (pre 2020) or if you used internal APIs.

## Meaning of Moment-of-Truth for 2sxc

The Moment of Truth (MoT) is a special release which

1. cleans up old cruft
1. removes very old APIs
1. removes old code which is no longer used
1. in rare cases, also removes old APIs which may have been used many years ago, but are almost never used anymore

> [!WARNING]
> MoT releases contain relevant breaking changes.
>
> They should rarely affect you, but you must test vigilantly.

1. MoT Editions will have extensive docs about the breaking changes
1. MoT Editions will have special guidance to help you migrate
1. MoT Editions will usually have built-in detection of code which may be affected by the breaking changes

## Volunteer Work

Please remember that 2sxc is free and open-source.
All the work is done by volunteers or by people who are paid by sponsors.
As such, these people will still make the decision if something is deemed critical or not, and who will implement the fix.

If you have a special need and wish to sponsor a fix in either an LTS or any other version, [do contact us](https://2sxc.org/en/contact)
