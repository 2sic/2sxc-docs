2sxc has many built-in extensions, and also allows you to create more extensions to enhance your Apps.

> This section of the docs is WIP, as we decided it should

> We only started moving things here for 2sxc v21, so it's still incomplete.

For now, best continue to: [](xref:Extensions.AppExtensions.Index)
