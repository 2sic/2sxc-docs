uid: ToSic.Eav.DataSources.EntityIdFilter
---

The **ItemIdFilter** [DataSource](xref:Specs.DataSources.DataSource) is part of the [Standard EAV Data Sources](xref:Specs.DataSources.ListAll). It will only return the items with the id specified. 

_Warning: You should always use it in combination with a [Content-Type filter](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.EntityTypeFilter), as you want to be sure nobody can just crawl any entity you have in your system!_

## How to use with the Visual Query
When using the [Visual Query](xref:ToSic.Eav.DataSources.Queries.VisualQueryAttribute) you can just drag it into your query. This is what it usually looks like:

<img src="/assets/data-sources/item-id-basic.png" width="100%">

You can also use multiple values:

<img src="/assets/data-sources/item-id-multiple.png" width="100%">

Or URL-parameters:

<img src="/assets/data-sources/item-id-url.png" width="100%">
