# Markdown for Text

If you're new to wikis or github comments / documentation, you may be a bit lost when it comes to markdown.
I think the most important things you need to know are these.


* Headers have 1-6 hashes in front, like `## Header 2`
* **bold** uses two `*` chars around the text, _\_italic\__ uses one `_` char
* escape chars with the `\` slash (so any character right after a \\ is shown and doesn't format)
* Linking has many options, better read the manuals
* Lists have many options, better read the manuals
* Images use a `![alt-text](/assets/path/file.ext)` syntax
* Note that line-breaks usually don't cause a line-break in the result (except in code-samples). You can enforce a simple line break by adding two spaces at the end of a line like "check out:  " (two spaces after the ":")
