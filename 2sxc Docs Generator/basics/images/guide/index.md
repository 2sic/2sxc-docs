# Images Guide (Best Practices & Code)

Images are a crucial part of every website and CMS. We want to be sure that:

1. Perfect Editing
    1. Editors can easily add images
    1. Editors can give titles to images
    1. Editors can have some control over how the image is shown - but not too much, it must be within the restrictions of the design
1. Perfect Output
    1. Images look great no matter what the editor does
    1. Images are accessible (for people with disabilities, etc.)
    1. Images use the latest possible file formats
    1. Images load quickly - which also requires images to be the best-possible size
1. Perfect SEO & Page Speed
    1. Images are optimized for search engines
    1. Images are optimized for page speed, especially mobile page speed
1. Pefect Control by the Designer
    1. The designer determines how images should look in various scenarios

We'll now explain the Parts that Make this Possible.

## Part 1: Edit UI / UX

The Edit UI presents various options to the user for uploading and configuring images. 

It's important to note that v13.10+ has a new feature to let the user customize what part of the image is really important (what corner/edge). 
This is important in scenarios where a resize would otherwise always show the middle, which may not be appropriate. 

Since this feature will only affect the output if the Razor template uses the [IImageService](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.IImageService),
the designer must activate it on the field. Otherwise the feature is not available. 

<img src="./assets/image-configuration.jpg" class="full-width" width="100%">

**Important**

This button is only available 
1. IF it has been enabled
1. and IF the file is an image
1. and IF the file "belongs" to the item being edited  
    If the file is a general file from another item or from the root folder, the metadata is not available. 
    This is important because files from elsewhere could be shared, and editing the metadata could have unexpected side-effects.

## Part 2: Image Metadata

When a user edits the image settings in the UI, the data is stored as [metadata](xref:Basics.Metadata.Index) for this image. 
This is important, because generating a perfect `<img>` or `<picture>` tag requires this information. 

## Part 3: Dynamic Field

If a content item stores the image on a property `.Image` then something like `Content.Image` would return `/Portal/0/Adam/some-image.jpg`.
In this case, the [IImageService](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.IImageService) cannot find the metadata.

This is why we need to give it the entire field, not just the value. This is done using `Content.Field("Image")` 
and will get your code a [IDynamicField](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Data.IDynamicField).

## Part 4: ImageService

The [IImageService](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.IImageService) will take all the known information and generate an `<img>` or a `<picture>` tag.

This can be used in its default implementation just using `.Img(Content.Field)` or `.Picture(...)`. 
In this case is uses the default `Content` settings (see below).

If you need more control, there are 3 options:

1. The `Img(...)` command has many more parameters for common scenarios such as using other settings, factor, imgAlt or imgClass
1. You can also generate very custom settings using the `.Settings(...)` command on the ImageService
1. You can also take the resulting object like `var img = imgSvc.Img(Content.Image)` and use it to generate the final tag yourself.

## Part 5: Settings and Recipes

**Settings** are preconfigured parameters how the image is to be resized. 
They are stored at App, Site, Global or Preset level. 

By default the configuration called `Content` is used for images in the Content of the page. 
Other settings also exist, such as `Lightbox` or `Screen`. 
You can also create your own configurations, such as `PersonProfile`. 

üëâüèº Read more about [Image Settings](xref:Basics.Configuration.Settings.Images.Index)

In your Razor code you can create new settings or modify existing ones using the `.Setting(...)` command on the ImageService.

* To create settings based on the `Content` use `.Setting("Content", ...)`
* To create brand new settings, use `.Setting(false, ...)`

**Recipes** define what variants of the image should be generated for other sizes, as well as other parameters to use when generating `img` or `picture` tags. 
The initial configuration is also stored in the settings and will be used, unless you specify something different. 

üëâüèº Read more about [Image Recipes](xref:Basics.Configuration.Settings.Images.Recipes)

You can also generate your own recipes:

* create a new recipe like this: `.Recipe("2x, 3x")` - this is only meant to create a quick recipe with a few variants.
* inherit/expand an existing recipe like this: `.Recipe(originalRecipe, ...)`
