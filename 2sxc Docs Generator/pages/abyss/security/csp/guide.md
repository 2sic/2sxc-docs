# Content Security Policy (CSP) Guide for 2sxc, Dnn and Oqtane

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security policy that helps you to protect your web application from [cross-site scripting attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).

In this guide we'll give you step-by-step instructions how to harden a website in no time. 
Basically with a bit of practice you can harden a DNN with Content-Security-Policy in about an hour ðŸš€.

ðŸŽ¬ Before you start, be sure you've read the [background, parts and best-practices](xref:Abyss.Security.Csp.Index).

## General Process

1. Do preparations
1. Setup CSP for anonymous users in reporting-only-mode with a reporting-server
1. Setup CSP for other users - reporting-only
1. Go productive
1. Monitor for a few days
1. Switch to full-mode

## CSP Preparations

### Prepare a Site for CSP

Before you try to configure CSP it's best to have a good setup which makes it easier. 
Rework your Skins / Apps to match a secure architecture, following the best practices. 
Things such as:

1. Get rid of unused js/css code/files
1. Reduce or better still, remove all jQuery dependent code (at least in anonymous mode)
1. Reduce all CDN references to as few as possible
1. Place all your inline scripts and styles in files
1. Change all inline `onclick` or `href:javascript:...` to be bound by the loaded code
1. Use [turnOn](xref:JsCode.TurnOn.Index) to couple the JS with Razor-data such as the ModuleId
1. Use [IPageService.Activate(...)](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.IPageService.Activate*) and [IPageService.AssetAttributes(...)](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Services.IPageService.AssetAttributes*) wherever possible

> [!TIP]
> All the latest standard 2sxc apps implement all these best practices. 
> If you still have older Apps, we suggest you install the latest on another server and copy the parts you need. 

### Prepare for Monitoring

Once you've deployed CSP you should get notified of any violations. 
The idea is that violations could just be a sign that something wasn't configured correctly and you may have missed this. 

There are some cool online services which can do this, like https://report-uri.com/. 
So we highly recommend you get an account to use for monitoring.



## Develop CSP Rules

### General Pattern

1. Always do dry-run tests first
    1. Create a new `Dev` policy and set it to _Report-Only_
    1. Test it using `?csp=dev` in the url
1. Choose to start restrictive or lax
    1. either start restrictive and open up the rules step-by-step
    1. or start with lax rules and tighten step-by-step
1. Once it works, apply to production as `...-Report-Only`
1. Repeat with other user roles



### Dry-Run Without Enforcing Policies

First you must enable the dev-feature.

<img src="./assets/manage-features-csp.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

Now you can test the policy by adding `?csp=dev` to any page. 
It will work with any login - as soon as you add the parameter, it will use the `Dev` settings.
This is how the dev settings could look:

<img src="./assets/site-settings-csp-dev.jpg" width="100%" class="full-width">

### Browser Setup

You will want to have a logged-in window to make configuration changes, and another window to test the policy.
You can either use two browsers (chrome+canary, chrome+firefox, firefox+edge, etc.) 
or a single browser with anonymous/guest modes to have different login states. 

As we're testing this, you will always need to add `?csp=dev` to the url you're testing. 

> [!TIP]
> In the window where you make the configuration, use Ctl+S to just save and not close the widow.
> This will make it much faster to try various setups.

> [!TIP]
> During development, please disable [LightSpeed Cache](xref:Abyss.Lightspeed.Index)
> as it may cache some settings, making it hard to debug. 

### Strict-First Method (recommended)

With Strict-First you start with very strict rules in `...-Report-Only` mode.
You will then review the errors you see in the browsers F12 console.
Then you will loosen up the rules step-by-step.

### Lax-First Method

The Lax-First method assumes that you start with rules that allow everything, then you tighten them up step-by-step.
Here's an example of a very lax rule set, taken from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35978863/allow-all-content-security-policy):

```text
default-src *  data: blob: filesystem: about: ws: wss: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-dynamic'
script-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'
connect-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'
img-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'
frame-src * data: blob:
style-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'
font-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'
frame-ancestors * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'
```

for 2sxc it can be shorted to:

```
// all-src would always be applied to all rules
all-src * data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'
default-src filesystem: about: ws: wss: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-dynamic'
script-src 'unsafe-eval'
```

You can now start to tighten up the rules.
