We've created a library to help you connect Angular with DNN called **dnn-sxc-angular**. You can find it here: [](xref:Npm.Dnn-Sxc-Angular).

To start, you should learn how to [install](xref:JsCode.Angular.DnnSxcAngular.Install).

The library contains the following bits of magic to get you going:

1. [Http Interceptor](xref:JsCode.Angular.DnnSxcAngular.HttpInterceptor) which ensures that all calls to DNN have the necessary security headers
1. Data API to quickly get data from WebAPIs
1. CMS directives to create toolbars in the Angular App for editing content


## Next Steps

1. Discover how Data is accessed from the Headless API
1. Discover how to use Queries
1. Discover how to use WebAPIs
1. Discover how to include CMS features like content-editing
