# AsDynamic({ "Some": "Json-String"}) - Magic Objects

2sxc v10.20 introduced another cool helper. It takes any JSON string and gives you a dynamic object to use in your code. 

The most common use is in GPS fields, where the data is stored as `{"Lat": 0.0, "Long": 0.0}`. But you can use it for so much more. 

âš¡ The [official API docs](xref:ToSic.Sxc.Code.IDynamicCode.AsDynamic(System.String,System.String)).

## Example

```c#
// assume Address is a Dynamic Entity with a Gps property

var coords = AsDynamic(Address.Gps);
var lat = coords.Lat;
var long = coord.Long;

```
