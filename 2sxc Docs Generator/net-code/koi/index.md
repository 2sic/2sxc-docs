# Koi Library

2sxc includes Koi - a helper library to let components / modules know what CSS framework is used, and use that information to create templates which adjust to that CSS framework. 

> [!TIP]
> 2sxc 11 introduced [Polymorphism](xref:Basics.Polymorphism.Index) which lets you place different _editions_ of a Razor file in folders matching various CSS frameworks. This is easiest way to leverage Koi, and your code doesn't even need to know about it. 

[!include["Koi Tutorials"](~/shared/tutorials/koi.md)]

## New Example (will only work in 2sxc v12)

2sxc v12 includes Koi 2.0 which uses Dependency Injection. Using this it also works in Oqtane. 

The following example will automatically include Bootstrap4 from a CDN if the theme doesn't already include it.

```razor
@{
  var pageCss = GetService<Connect.Koi.ICss>();
}
@if(!pageCss.Is("bs4")) {
  <link rel="stylesheet" 
    href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
    integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" 
    crossorigin="anonymous">
}
```


## Old Example (will only work in Dnn â˜¢)

The following example will automatically include Bootstrap4 from a CDN if the theme doesn't already include it.

```razor
@using Connect.Koi;
@if(!Koi.Is("bs4")) {
  <link rel="stylesheet" 
    href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
    integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" 
    crossorigin="anonymous">
}
```
