# EAV & 2sxc Docs v11.10.02

This is the documentation for EAV and 2sxc APIs. It's fairly advanced, so if you're new to 2sxc, best start with [2sxc.org](https://2sxc.org/).

## 2sxc - The CMS / CMF of DNN (DotNetNuke)
2sxc is a CMS-Plugin for [DNN/DotNetNuke](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/). It makes content editing easier than Wordpress. It's also a [CMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_frameworks) like Drupal. And a very cool EAV data-management system. And an online REST JSON database. And a lot more.

2sxc is basically used to provide web-site-builder functionality to DNN, both in a simple **Content** mode (where users just add images, designed text/image blocks, links etc.) or in **App** mode, where user add standalone functional apps like blogs, galleries and more. Most apps are on github and can be downloaded from the [app-catalog](https://2sxc.org/en/apps).
