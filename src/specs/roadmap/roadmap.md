# Roadmap of EAV and 2sxc - Vision of the Future

The 2sxc roadmap contains the things we think are fairly important to tackle next. Since we're all working for free, there is no commitment to do this in the order you see below. And sometimes a customer will need a feature quickly - and pay for it - then it will appear sooner. _You too can sponsor a feature!_

## Next Priorities (2020 Q4)

1. Create an LTS of 2sxc 11
1. Provide more help UIs for using REST APIs
1. Make the Metadata-System completely discoverable
1. Enable 2sxc run on [Oqtane](https://www.oqtane.org/)
1. Formula based field calculations and formula based show/hide or required/not-required fields


## Future / Other
* [ ] Support for persisting data to the file-system instead of DB
* [ ] Files DataSource
* [ ] ADAM DataSource
* [ ] Pages DataSource
* [ ] Navigation DataSource
* [ ] ...or whatever is needed next :)
