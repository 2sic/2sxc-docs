## Breaking Changes in EAV and 2sxc v14

We try to minimize breaking changes, and most breaking changes won't affect your work, because it's internal API. 
We're documenting it here to ensure you know what happened, in case you still run into this.

### Summary

V14 did some clean-up of internal APIs, but otherwise there are no known breaking changes.
